Week 1 Visualization : Every Country Has Its Climate Crisis. What's Yours?

Starts with President Biden and his hopes to tackle the climate crisis. However, then it let's you put in the country that you are from, assuming that the target audience is not just people that live in the United States. Therefore, that first statement seems to exclude a lot of people from intereacting with the visualization. 

The visualization flows with the storytelling. It has the visualization in the background and an explenation/context for it on top, and as you scroll down the application walks you through the map visualization. 

At first, it was easy to see the difference between the different zones (since they had different colors). Since it didnt' have a legend, the user was left to assume what the colors meant (the blue color that is found near Honk Kong and the East Coast of the US would be high risk)

However, as you scroll down, the visualization changes to a graph that depends on depth. It was hard to tell which bar was higher than the other given that they were all in different depths. The only factor that could help was the different colors that were presented. 

In addition, as you move to other places in the world, the vertical rectangles get smaller and bigger, and yet the text makes it clear that those places are still at a very high risk. 

At the end, I am still very confused as to what the bars and colors mean. I think having an article acompany it would make it a lot easier to digest than vague sentences. 

However, this visualization is still useful to get a very high level understanding of the climate change dangers that countries are facing. If you look up different countries, you will learn how each country will be affected differently (with text accompanied with visuaizations).
