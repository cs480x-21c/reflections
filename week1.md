# Week 1 Reflection - "Whiter than Golf"


[What's Whiter than Golf and "Horse Girls"](https://freaktakes.substack.com/p/whats-whiter-than-golf-and-horse)

While browsing Reddit's Data is Beautiful I stumbled upon this very entertaining 'enjoy' visualisation.
The visualisation itself is pretty straight forward, however I think the interesting part comes from the data collection and selection.
In order to find what activities white people do in their spare time Eric Gilliam used Emergency Room data.
The assumption here is that on average everyone gets injured at the same rate assuming they are doing the same activity.
The source of this data is not from every hospital in the US but rather of a representative sample sourced from the Consumer Product Safety Commission.
Additionally, inorder to avoid over representation of injuries he limited it to cases that effected over 20 people. 

The data here was visualized using color saturation.
Although there are plenty of visualisation techniques that could have been empirically more effective (such as position on a common scale),
I believe that this choice was still very effective in this case.
The quick change in color at the top of chart helps to indicate how strongly correlated with white people those injuries were,
and although the other injuries are still mostly white they are not as drastic in this limited scale.
