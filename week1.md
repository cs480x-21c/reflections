This is a visualization about the cricket stadiums used for the ICC Cricket World Cup 2019, hosted in England and Wales. Most people assume that cricket is played on spherical fields. Moreover, cricket grounds aren't uniform in terms of length from the center as well. This visualization shows that cricket grounds vary in terms of shapes and sizes. This visualization features 11 stadiums, displaying each of them in terms of their geographical features, shape, pitch area, and dimensions (along with shortest and longest sides from the batsmen's point of view). Sometimes the shapes are rectangular, hexagonal, and oval apart from being circular. There are some instances where the ground appears circular (but not perfectly circular). In some instances, there are great differences in the shortest and the longest side of the field, such as in case of the Lord's stadium in London, where the difference is in the order of 20 metres. This also shows not only the irregularities in the dimensions of the field but also the case where cricket matches might get affected due to long distances between the batsmen and the boundaries. The cricket fields where the length is shorter are the places where there are high chances to score more runs, whereas lengthy grounds are the places where a more defensive mindset might be the best tactic to implement. Because the sides change after each over (bowling round), there might be cases when the batsmen needs to change his attacking options depending on the side he/she is facing. An interesting thing about this visualization is its presentation: not like some conventional graph, chart or plot but more like using the geometry of the fields.
