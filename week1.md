This graph is really interesting to me for a number of reasons. First of all, the way it visualizes the class combinations with strings (or, rather, chords) with colors that fade into one another allows it to deliver a lot of information in a singular format. The cursor mouseover function giving more specific is also highly useful for those interested in the details behind the numbers.

The most important thing this piece of data visualization introduced to me, though, was the software used to make it. There are a lot of options for what can be done with the software - all of which can serve as inspiration for future projects.

The one change I would make to this visualization would be for clicks rather than mouseovers of chords to show the champions. Particularly for the larger groupings, it can be really hard to see the chord itself depending on where the info window appears. When I get to making data visualization, I should definitely keep placement of information relative to user experience in mind.
