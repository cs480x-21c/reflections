# Reflection

The visualization I have chosen to reflect on can be found at https://old.reddit.com/r/dataisbeautiful/comments/ickvfq/oc_two_thousand_years_of_global_temperatures_in/.

I chose this one because it uses a line graph in a interesting way that I've never seen before. Most line graphs I've seen display the entire dataset at once. However, this one shows displays how the line moves over time by showing the graph frame-by-frame. The line graph in the first frame displays data for year zero. Consecutive frames show the line graph advanced by a year. I think that making the line move like this shows how the data changes over time more effectively than displaying a line graph for an entire dataset. I think it also presents an opportunity to make a visualization more expository. For example, this visualization tries to make a point about global warming by showing that global temperatures underwent a sharp increase during the 21st century. It seems to me that animating this increase makes more of an impression on the audience than using a line graph in a more conventional way, because the audience watches the line increase. I also think that animating a line graph like this conveys the structure of a dataset in a more entertaining way. Rather than viewing the line's entire journey, the audience only sees its current position and is waiting to see where it will eventually end up, which adds an element of suspense.
