Author Notes:
I made this visual using R with ggplot and ScreentoGif using data from this 2019 Nature Geoscience study (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6675609/).

Raw data is available here: (www.ncdc.noaa.gov/paleo/study/21171).

Climate model runs are available here: (http://pcmdi9.llnl.gov/).

Outcomes of the study are available here: (https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/paleo/study/26872).

The line represents the twenty-year rolling average of yearly temperature deviation from the 1961-1990 average global temperature.
