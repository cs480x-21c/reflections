Link to "All of Europe's skyscrapers on one map" from dataisbeautiful on Reddit: https://www.reddit.com/r/dataisbeautiful/comments/leowbf/all_of_europes_skyscrapers_on_one_map_every/

This visualization shows different European countries and how many buildings they have over 150 meters (492ft) tall. This measurement is the widely accepted height of a building that would be considered a skyscraper. Also to be determined a true skyscraper, a building must have habitable floor space of at least 50% of the structure's total height (https://www.theb1m.com/video/what-is-a-skyscraper). The title of the visualization is "Skyscrapers in Europe" and the only indicator of what buildings would be considered are the height requirements. I am curious if the creators of this visualization also took into account the habitable floor space aspect of being a true skyscraper and whether or not that would change the visualization.
There is a lot of data shown on this visualization that causes the visualization to be a little busy. The map of the countries is a unique way to present the information and make it visually appealing. However, it is somewhat hard to read some of the numbers on top of the countries which are supposed to represent how many skyscrapers are in the country. Maybe choosing a different color for the numbers could help. There is also no key for what a grey-colored country means, although one could assume it means there are no skyscrapers in that country. I did like the addition of the bar chart that shows the number of skyscrapers per individual city as it added more information to the visualization.
