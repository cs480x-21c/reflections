Week 1 Reflection: [Saharan dust moving into North Africa and Southern Europe](https://www.reddit.com/r/dataisbeautiful/comments/le1th1/saharan_dust_moving_into_north_africa_and/)

For this week's reflection, I chose a visualization from r/dataisbeautiful. A [tweet](https://twitter.com/WMO/status/1358028244201611265), February 6th, from the World Meteorological Organization states that "a major intrusion of Saharan sand and dust has dramatically altered the skies over Europe". As a result the sky and snow across parts of Europe turned orange.
This visualization is a map of Europe and Africa with an animated progression of Saharan dust movement. The data used for the visualization ranges from February 4th to February 6th. There is also a colored scale for the Dust Extinction Aerosol Optical Thickness that ranges from 0.00 to 3.00. The colors in the scale are white, orange, purple and black.

This visualization's purpose appears to present a specific range of a larger dataset. It might be interesting to see the same visualization with an extended range to understand what "normal" conditions look like.

This type visualization appears to be popular for meteorological data because it is able to be animated and displays the changes in the data in a understandable way. As a result, I think that this type visualization is the best way to represent the movement of Saharan dust across continents. Though, I think this visualization can be improved by including more appealing colors by either using a different color scale or adding the topology over the land. Another improvement would be to make this visualization interactive, since the visualization is based on time it would be interesting to pause at a certain time and be able to scrub to another time. Also, The visualization might be more comprehensible if the measurement (Dust Extinction Aerosol Optical Thickness) was explained a little.
