While this photo by itself seems rather uneventful, I thought it would be good to talk about for a week 1 reflection. This is because of how it chooses to portray its information.
The title of this photo is "Where do the worlds ~1 billion sheep live?", marking the amount of sheep by the density and darkness of green.
I think this data could be much better represented in multiple ways. I think having a spread of different colors which coorespond to the density of sheep in the area would help with clarification.
As well as a scale in the bottom corner of the map to help with accurate data representation and make the map as a whole easier to digest and understand.

One interesting feature about this map is that as you zoom in, you can see a lot more specific detail. An example of this is how the UK has a pretty massive amount of sheep,
but if you zoom directly into London you can see a void in the map. This is true for multiple other cities around Europe and gives me a lot higher confidence in the data representation.
