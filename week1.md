This is an interactive visualization. I've included screenshots here: https://imgur.com/a/9TExBEM however it's better to go to the actual visualization website here: https://www.ytb-network.com/. Viz sourced from reddit thread https://www.reddit.com/r/dataisbeautiful/comments/leva2m/oc_small_part_of_youtube_channel_recommendations/

This visualization is an interactive network-type visualization showing the links between YouTube channels that "recommend" each other on their sidebars. From my (admittedly rather small amount of) testing it seems to include most YouTube channels considered to be "popular", at least in the US. Interestingly enough, however, the creator of this project seems to be from France. In the "about" section of the visualization they said that they started from 54 french channels, and eventually lead to over 5000 channels being a part of the visualization. I found it incredibly interesting how a visualization like this is able to group similar channels together, and portray different "clusters" of channels that are all related to each other. I would also be curious to know how the color-coding of clusters works. It seems to aid in the distinction between different groups, but it's not clear how the "border" is determined between one cluster and another. The viz author also mentions that the placement of nodes is done using "Force Atlas 2 repartition." From a quick Google search this seems to be some sort of algorithm specifically designed for placing nodes in networked visualizations, but I'd be interested in learning more about the specifics. I also like the ability to search up YouTubers and see where they fall in the network. It's interesting to see how the YouTubers I'm interested in relate to each other, and was not surpised to see a lot of them either in the same clusters or close to each other in the network.
