This visualization is about suicide.
I found *A view on Despair* from a thumbnail, not beginning to realize what the visualization actually entailed.  
I thought it looked very pretty, a cool way of displaying some as-of-yet-unknown information, that maybe it was something to do with nature or climate change.  
I saw the title, *A view on despair*, and thought that it was probably about climate change, despairing for the damage being done every year.  
I opened the link, and nothing could have prepared me for reading the introduction.  
Or scrolling through the full-sized visualization.   
Or reading through the legend, or the breakdown of genders, or any of the supporting graphics following the main visualization.  
This visualization is an experience that can only be really *felt* by starting with the introduction and reading all of the way through to the end.  
I think that, in a sort of poetic sense, it is very nice that each of the data points in this graph are represented by something beautiful and natural rather than just a dot.  
Each of those elements represents a life lost, and you can see the care that the designer put into making them special in the legend. 
They're not just the same svg scaled up or down, or given a different color, but rather each instance in the visualization feels special and unique.  
I think that this visualization clearly qualifies as art just as much as it does a data visualization.  

Because the main visualization is so large, the supporting graphs at the end help to give a quantitative look at the data being presented.  
There is a lot of information being provided in the key and notes scattered around the final graph, which give short, helpful analyses of the data.  
The middle graphs, the L/R gender breakdown and detailed legend, which I would consider to be a continuation of the storytelling part of the graphic, carried a lot of weight for me.  
The legend in particular made me scroll back up to the main graphic more than once, just to look at each of the elements being visualized.
