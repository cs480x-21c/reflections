The visualization I chose was a heatmap of all the wards I have placed in the video game dota 2.
Dota is a 5v5 MOBA where both teams have incomplete information and try to gain a gold and xp advantage to destroy the opponent's ancient.
Tracking where your opponents are on the map is really important.
There are two types of wards that you can place and both of them are invisible.
Observer wards provide regular vision over an area, and sentry wards allow you to see invisible enemies in the area, but don't provide normal vision.
The visualization is interesting because I can see where are the most common places where I placed wards.
I also have the option to look at wards placed when playing different characters and it was interesting to see where I placed wards depending on whether I was playing an aggressive character or a more passive character.
Furthermore, I could look at ward spots in games were we won vs where we lost and see what areas of the map it was more important to place wards at.
The visualization also had the option to show my ward placement throughout different iterations of the game, and it was interesting to see my ward placement get more diverse as I played the game for longer. 
I also looked at some heatmaps for pro players and was able to learn some more creative ward spots that the opponents would typically not expect.
Many of the pro players' heatmaps didn't actually have any locations of really high intensity for warding, which makes a lot of sense, since they want to be very unpredictable in their warding so they enemy doesn't know where they placed their wards.
