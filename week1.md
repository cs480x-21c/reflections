This is a visualization that has been used in my bioinformatics research lab.

The plots are mapping gene expression of cells in the brain, each point represents an individual cell. The structure of the plot is the same for all 4 plots, but the color scheme is different. The title of each plot represents a neuronal gene, and the color of each cell represents the expression of that gene. 

I thought that this was a good example of the way our brains process color, like we talked about in the first lecture. It was designed to range from a light grey meaning no expression, to a dark purple meaning high expression. This makes the plot very easy to interpret. SLC17A7 and SATB2 are known marker genes for glutamatergic neurons, while GRIN1 and GRIN2B are marker genes for most neuron types. From the colors of the plots, we can easily pick out clusters of cells that are glutamatergic neurons.

This is also a great example of making detailed visualizations without making it overwhelming. The way that they were designed implemented marker gene analysis 1 cell type at a time. It would have been much more confusing and overwhelming to include several dozen marker genes to identify every cell type that exists in the brain.
