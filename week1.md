This vizualization is a video of the best selling artists from 1969 - 2019. I think it is really good at showing which artists maintained the most popluarity over time. Its also very entertaining to watch thanks to its speed and neat animations when a artists passes others. Especially when a really popular artist is rising and they explode and go up really fast.
