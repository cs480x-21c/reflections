# Week 1 Reflection
For this initial reflection I wanted to actually use a vis I found during class last Thursday that I found absolutely incredible and wanted to investigate more and share. 
[The Codex Atlanticus](https://www.codex-atlanticus.it/#/) is the largest exisitng colleciton of original drawing and texts by Leonardo da Vinci and is beautifully
visualized and freely accessible now.
