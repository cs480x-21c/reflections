# Reflection - Week 1

For this weeks reflection, I found the article ["Berlin-Marathon 2016 – So schnell läuft Ihre Stadt"](https://interaktiv.morgenpost.de/berlin-marathon-2016/) which translates to "Berlin Marathon 2016 - How Fast Your City Is Running". I was unable to find an English version of the article, however, I was able to use a Google Chrome extension to translate the page. The article discusses the average amount of time required to complete the Berlin Marathon, separating participants based on factors such as their gender, what country they come from or what state in Germany they come from. The reason this article caught my eye was due to the interactive map featured prominently at the top. For those who are unable to translate the page, here's a picture of the translated map.

The map shows, in real time, how racers progressed through the race using small dots to represent each racer. You can control the speed at which the race is played at, as well as, be able to jump to any point in the race. Using these tools, the article lets you visualize other statistics, such as, highlighting the fastest, slowest or most average racer; visualizing a custom racer that finishes the race in any specified time; filtering out male or female racers or following a racer who came from a specified location. These options are totally optional. The user can simply enjoy the default settings when they enter the page. The visuals as a whole are laid out excellently, where all of the information is presented in an easy to understand and visually appealing way. All of the options and their effects are clearly labeled and indicated on the diagram. The visuals invite the reader in to learn more about the race in a streamlined manner.

The article itself does feature information about the average racing times and rankings for certain categories, though all the information can be found using the interactive map. However, this does point out a flaw with the map's design in terms of information discoverability. While there are features that enable easy discoverability, finding certain information can be tedious and cumbersome. For example, to find the information present in the tables found in the article, you are required to manually search for them use the search bar to the side of the map. This feature feels disconnected from the ease of use found within the map options, however, alternate solutions may yield worse results.

Overall, I think this site nails its purpose; the presentation is beautiful and presents the information perfectly. The interactivity draws people in to discover more about the topic. While some information is obscured and hard to find, it won't be an issue except for those truly invested. I think this article is a great mixture of both form and functionality that is greatly enhanced by its visuals and interactivity.
