# Writeup
This simulation uses the Boids (bird-oid object) AI model, which was created in 1986 by Craig Reynolds. This is used to simulate the flocking behavior of birds. The boids follow three fundamental interaction rules.

1. Seperation: to avoid collision and crowding of the birds within their flock.
2. Alignment: to travel in the same direction of their flock.
3. Cohesion: to navigate towards their flock's center of mass.

This model can be used in robotics and computer animation. According to wikipedia, the first computer animation created by the model was 'Stanley and Stella in: Breaking the Ice': [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3bTqWsVqyzE&ab_channel=VintageCG.]

This has been adopted in the field of swarm robotics in order to create autonomous vehicles without the need for communication. Here is an example: [https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1748-3190/abc6b3]. For applications like these, more interaciton rules can be applied. For example, obstacle avoidance. 

I could see this being applied in the programming of swarm drones, for example, those which drop seeds to replant forests after deforestation. In the case of forest fires or mountain ranges, the terrain is often unsafe for humans, which can further make these swarms a huge advantage. Using a flocking model, with a specific seperation distances, drones could fly together to release seeds evenly over an entire range of land. Unfortunatly, I can imagine those same exact drones being used in warfare.
