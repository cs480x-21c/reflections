There are countless visualizations of climate change, but I ran across a particularly good one the other day called [En-Roads](https://en-roads.climateinteractive.org/scenario.html?v=2.7.36). It was created by a think tank, Climate Interactive, that was founded by MIT graduates. Additionally, it has been regularly updated to keep up with the current understanding of climate change.

I actually found this visualization while completing work for another class that I am in, Biodiversity, and immediately thought about this class. This interactive is an incredibly good example of what we would categorize under 'Explore'. By default, it visualizes temperature changes based on predicted factors (energy makeup, transport, industry, etc.) The real meat of it, however, is in how it allows the users to adjust the various factors that play into its calculations of future temperature changes. The user can adjust any of them as they see fit and see how big of a positive / negative impact it is theorized to have on future temperature changes.

Beyond just showing the effects on climate change on global average temperature, this visualization also shows the effects of its predicted scenario on a number of other areas such as the cost of energy, population growth, and more. These secondary predictions are also affected by the user-adjusted factors. All in all, this visualization does an incredibly job of giving the user a simple, readily understandable, and holistic look at climate change.
