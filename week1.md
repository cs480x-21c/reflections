This visualization shows the median US weekly earning by sex and race/ethnicity. This plot is a variation of a 3D bar chart. The visualization itself is slightly awkward in this case since something such as a multi-line chart would be superior. This design does however portray the data reasonably well. I like how both the height and color determines the median weekly earnings. Just looking at a chart of one single color or one height and varying colors may be difficult to interpret, however combining the two makes it much easier to look at. Aside from the visualization, the data protrayed is interesting as there is clearly a gap between men and women across all years shown. Something I noticed was a slight jump in salaries in the year 2020, perhaps this could be an outcome of covid?
