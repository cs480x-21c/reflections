Chosen vis: http://listen.hatnote.com/

This visualization is aptly titled "Listen to Wikipedia". It displays _live_
edits to wikipedia with bubbles corresponding to the size of the edit. Each 
bubble is labeled with the associated wiki page and colored to show if
a human or bot made the edit. Additionally, a tone whose frequency is determined 
by the size of the edit is played as they occur.

The reason I admire this visualization is because of the incredibly way that it
conveys the sheer size of the wikipedia project. Selecting only the english
wikipedia you can listen to the music this website creates as a near constant 
melody, and interact with the many bubbles that appear. 

In the past, I would frequently open this website while doing work because it 
_strangly_ made me feel as though others around me were being productive, akin
to working in a library. The transient nature of this visualization is a 
wonderful display of how to convert the mass of data that is represented. 
Because bubbles are always fading, and being replaced with new edits, 
this visualization conveys far more than most static graphs or summaries would.

Though not strictly _visual_ the use of sounds to accompany the data display 
adds to the feeling of _evergrowing_, and I believe conveys similar messaging to 
Drowning in plastic.
