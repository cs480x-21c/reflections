## Week 1 Reflection - Most Popular Web Browsers between 1995 and 2019

https://www.reddit.com/r/dataisbeautiful/comments/ija2rc/oc_most_popular_web_browsers_between_1995_and_2019/

I was browising r/dataisbeautiful on Reddit and came on this interactive visualization of the most popular web browsers between
1995 and 2019. I thought this visualization was interesting because it interactively showed how the web browsers changed popularity through
the years, especially after the '.com' boom. The source of this data came from Wikipedia, an article on the usage share of Web Browsers. It meausured how many
people used which search engine for each month of the year. 

The user who did this visualization found the data off Wikipedia, and created it into a pie chart video. I found it interesting how Internet Explorer
lasted for so long :). This visualization would most definitely be under a 'Present' Category. I really liked how the visualization was a video 
of the data moving. There could have different visualization techniques used, but I think this one was the most effective for this data.
I think it would have been a bit boring if the visualization was just a standard pie chart, or if a different type of a chart that didn't show
the data moving. This visualization caught my eye because it showed real time how the browsers changed popularity, which was an interactive
way to show this data.
