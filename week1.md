Data vis - https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/super-bowl-ads/
This data vis is a collection of 233 Super Bowl adds separated into 8 categories and is very much an enjoyment driven visualization. When I usually think of a data visualization, the first things that come to mind are charts and lots of colorful lines or shapes. However, in this vis, it is only a composition of videos. Something that comes to mind when seeing all these videos is YouTube and it was interesting to see how this vis organized this information. As seen on the bottom of the page videos can take up quite a large amount of space. I think the video bars is a great solution for space purposes and it neatly organizes a group of videos for the category combos they showcase. Also, the addition of a universal volume and mute slider at the top of the page was incredibly useful, but only once I found it. Another trouble I ran into was trying to find the videos the article spoke about in the video bars. An added element here that might be interesting is when hovering over certain text, would expand the relevant video. A link to another webpage works occasionally, however if the video is already on the page, there should be no point in redirecting the user elsewhere. I think there is a lot still unexplored in showcasing video information, that is interesting to compare with other sites like twitch and YouTube.
