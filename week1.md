2/7/21 Reflection

In this reflection, I'll be reviewing [this data visualization](https://i.redd.it/sio4q2rh5wf61.png) that describes the details and history of the coin flip at 
the beginning of the Super Bowl since 1965. My first impression of this data visualization is the thought: Why does this exist? Do people actually base their decision of
what the coin flip will be at the beginning of a current game based upon previous coin flips and patterns? In regards to the visualization itself, there definitely appears
to be alot of data in one area, which makes it a little hard to read at first. Also, the visualization is very plain, meaning there's no fancy animation, or movement in the
data at all. It's simply a static image. I thought the color choice was interesting to convey the difference between heads and tails, yes and no, and a win or a loss. The
visualization uses a gold color to denote 'heads, and a silver color to denote 'tails'. This makes it easy to tell the difference between the two options because these two
colors constrast each other well, just ad red and green do when the visualizaiton denoted between yes and no, or wins and losses. Another thing that made the visualization 
easier to read is that the binary options for each piece of data analyzed were displayed on a time line, in which when one option was picked, it was always placed visually
above the alternate option. This made it easy to read and determine what happened each year. It also made is easier to read patterns in the data. For example, between 2000
and 2010, the statistic of the the coin flip being called accurately flipped back and forth between yes and no every single year. Overall, I thought this data visualization
was really interesting because of it's organization and it's content.
