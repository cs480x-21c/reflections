Week 1 Reflections
==

This week I focused on an article by FiveThirtyEight, called "How Fast Is The Economy Recovering?". 
The page discusses the difference between unemployment rates in pre-pandemic and post-pandemic times. 
The unemployemnt rates are tracked through time, by race, and by different private sectors.
The authors promise to update the article every month so that change over time can be seen. 


I liked this article, because it provided a deeper outlook on an issue that is very widely discussed nowadays. 
From Visual perspective, I liked the soft colors used for the overall and by race graphs. 
The animated unemployment rates by sector visual was a bit confusin as, at first, it was not directly clear what each new highlighted part meant(which sector of economy).

Overall, most of these visualizations are not meant to be self-contained. They are meant to be part of the article, which fills the informational gaps of the visualizations.
I like the designs and color choices of the visualization as they are simple, with muted colors, and correlative. The promise of updates each month is a nice addition, as I am would like
to see how these figures change month by month.
