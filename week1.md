Data visualization on YouTube has been my greatest exposure to the field. 
Personally, several videos of animated bar graphs to show popularity over time have been recommended to me personally.
Examples of this include channels like https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCZuMHuKUhsYDntHM1nW0MKA and https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCUN-6bbEHtiYg2cZEbGpiCg/featured, both of which specialize in these types of videos.
These kinds of videos can get up to hundreds of thousands of views- especially ones informing about the coronavirus, for obvious reasons, but more than that, they're very accessible and easy to understand.
This kind of video is extremely easy to understand for just about anyone, since the field of data they measure can be quantified by specific numbers over a specific period of time.
They feature music and and interesting colors to keep the audience entertained as they sit through minutes on end of numbers going up.
And I'm sure the algorithm started picking up on even innocuous visualizations once the coronavirus hit and people started watching them en masse.
One particular channel that goes above and beyond with this type of content is https://www.youtube.com/user/1abacaba1/featured, which features the traditional racing bar graph style videos as well as other unique visualizations.
They even feature historical facts about each year in history they speed through in their visualizations, to help pad out the monotony of minute changes.
All of their subjects, of course, are measured over time- video length seems like the perfect axis for measuring changes over time.
