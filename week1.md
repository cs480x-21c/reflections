# Reflection - Week 1

For this weeks reflection, I found the article ["Berlin-Marathon 2016 – So schnell läuft Ihre Stadt"](https://interaktiv.morgenpost.de/berlin-marathon-2016/) which translates to "Berlin Marathon 2016 - How Fast Your City Is Running". I was unable to find an English version of the article, however, I was able to use a Google Chrome extension to translate the page for me. The article discusses the average amount of time required to complete the Berlin Marathon, separating participants based on factors such as their gender, what country they come from or what state in Germany they come from. The reason this article caught my eye was do to the interactive map featured predominantly at the top. For those who are unable to translate the page, here's a picture of the translates map.

The map shows in real time how racers progressed through the race using small dots to represent each racer. You can control the speed at which the race is played at as well as jump to any point in the race. Through this, the article lets you visualize other statistics such as highlighting the fastest, slowest or most average racer, visualize a custom racer that finishes the race in any specified time, filtering out male or female racers or following a racer who came from a specified location. These options are totally optional however and the user can simply enjoy the default settings when they enter the page. While the article itself does feature information about the average racing times and rankings for certain categories, all the information can be found using the interactive map. However, this does point out a flaw with the map's design in terms of information discoverability. While there are a easily accessible discoverability features, finding the information present in these charts can be very tedious and cumbersome, requiring you to manually search for them in the search bar. Its a small instance of form over functionality, however, it doesn't hold the site back from its goal. Overall, I think this site nails its purpose, the presentation is beautiful and presents the information perfectly. The interactivity draws people in to discover more about the topic by having the options and their effects clearly laid out. While some information is obscured and hard to find, it won't be an issue except for those truly hardcore. I think this article is a great mixture of both from and functionality.
