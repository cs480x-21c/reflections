Week 4 Reflection: Historic Country Borders

---
For this week's reflection, I chose a [visualization](https://historicborders.app/?view=globe) regarding historic country borders.
I chose this visualization because I think it was well done and neatly presents the data. The visualization is a map/globe that displays the borders between countries/regions over time. The timeline ranges from 2000 BC to 1994. I think the timeline at the top is a big piece to why this visualization is so interesting to me. Being able to interact and see how the borders change over time is really fascinating and the time between interactions is fairly quick. However, the timeline only presents pre-selected years so it would not be possible to look at a specific year that is not already designated. In the globe perspective you can use your mouse to move the globe to an area you want visible. Also, each nation/ region is a different color to more easily distinguish the boundaries. The map utilizes Mapbox and the [data](https://github.com/aourednik/historical-basemaps) was compiled and made available on Github. Overall, I think the map/globe are excellent visualizations for presenting this type of data in an easy to understand way.
