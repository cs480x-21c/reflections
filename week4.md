Visualization: https://www.reddit.com/r/dataisbeautiful/comments/lui8fa/oc_what_are_the_most_popular_operating_systems/

This is an animated visualization showing the most popular operating systems in use (accoridng to GlobalStats statcounter) from January 2009 through January 2021. The visualization is structured as a bar chart showing percentage (market share) of each operating system, and the bars can shift places as time continues to elapse. The author of the visualization says in their post that the visualization was created using d3. I was really impressed knowing this (and knowing how complicated d3 can be), and observing how professional looking and smooth the animation is. 

This visualization also provides some really interesting insight regarding not just what the most popular operating systems have been, but how our use of technology has changed. There are really significant milstones when mobile operating systems surpass some of their desktop counterparts, as phones have become more and more popular. Of note is when iOS surpassed MacOS in January of 2010. However, a milestone that's even more significant is when longtime operating system leader Windows was surpassed by Android in March of 2017. It's incredibly interesting to see that for the past few years a mobile operating system has been more popular than a desktop operating system, and it suggests a big shift in our society about phone usage vs. desktop/laptop computer usage.

Some other parts of the visualization that I really liked was the use of color to represent the different operating systems (with specific attention paid to matching the colors with the corresponding operating system's logo), as well as the fluid and professional looking animations and transitions as the bars move around to reflect the changes in the rankings.
