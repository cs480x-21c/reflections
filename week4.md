# Week 4 Relection
This week I wanted to learn more about some of the different graph talked about in Visual Analysis and Design. In chapter 7 polar graphs were mentioned. It's a graph I've known
about but never really saw much use of in real world examples. While on r/dataisbeautiful I found this super interesting graphic visualizing the performance of NHL players for
the current season.
