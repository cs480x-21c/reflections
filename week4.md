# Week 4 Reflection - COVID Vaccine Rollout per State

[See How the Vaccine Rollout is Going in Your State](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/us/covid-19-vaccine-doses.html)

This visualization, as its title suggests, shows vaccine doses per state.
This week's visualization comes from the New York Times. 
So far this class has showed me that the New York Times continuously does an excellent job making visualizations.
This visualization was no exception. 
Not only is it very easy to find more information about any state, but you can see the data in multiple other formats.
Further down the page there is a daily bar chart with a 7-day moving average of vaccines administer per day.
There is also a graph that shows the prediction of what percentage of the country will be vaccinated at what time given the current vaccination pace.
Finally, there is a chart that shows what ages are currently eligible for vaccination at this point. 

As a whole this visualisation does a very good job at being not only attention gathering but easy to understand and explore.
