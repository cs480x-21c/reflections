This website uses a map and a circular bar plot to display information about a region. The map includes many dots with hover features to show which region that bubble represents.
There are 11 topics measured for each region: Safety, Housing, Life Satisfaction, Access to Services, Civic Engagement, Education, Jobs, Community, Environment, Income, and Health.
Each topic gets a score out of 10, with a high score indicating better performance relative to other regions. Scrolling down on the website will show a more detailed evaluation of
that region and compare it to other regions. This detailed section also shows the indicators for why the region scored the way it did for that topic. Hovering over a section will 
give more information about it in a pop-up window. In Massachusetts the education indicator states 93.8% of the labor force have at least a secondary education. Across all regions,
Massachusetts is in the top 11% for education. This data comes from the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) Regional Database. The OECD is an intergovernmental economic
organisation with 37 member countries. This means not every country is represented in this visualization. If the data set spanned even more countries, I think the visualization 
would be even more interesting.
