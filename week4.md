This data visualization compares the effects of eating a beyond meat patty and a beef patty. The contrasting green and orange colors make the visualization color-blind friendly. The labels and axes are clean, concise, and easy to read. As for the data, I found this very interesting as I have started to eat less beef after watching Game Changers (which I highly recommend watching even if you have no intention to stop eating beef, itâ€™s very interesting!) Not only is the water use astonishing, but the greenhouse gas emissions stood out to me like a sore thumb. I had known that cows produce a lot of methane, but compared to a factory I thought they would be impact-less. This chart obviously shows the opposite, however, which is very impressive. I hope to see a reduction in price of non-beef patties as sales volume increases to make them more affordable. Hopefully this will help combat climate change!
