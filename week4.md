### Description
The data viz presented here is a graph that dictates the relationship between electric and diesel cars, and their respective
costs over time. As many people know, the production of electric cars are the dominating the car markets, with companies
such as nio and Tesla leading the way. However, a major concern is the cost of these vehicles. As this graph indicates, 
the cost to purchase an electric car is high. However, over time the total expenses on that car (i.e gas) is significantly
less than that of a diesel vehicle. However, one interesting thing to note is that the title is a little misleading as it 
is vague. The blanket statement that electric cars are cheaper to run that petroleum-fueled cars is not true for many examples. 
The Tesla Model S Long Range Plus at over $550 is way more expensive to operate than the Honda Civic $350. 
Anyone who initially sees this graphic then looks closer will be annoyed at apparently being deceived. In my opinion, it would
be better to say that electric cars are comparable, often cheaper to operate.
