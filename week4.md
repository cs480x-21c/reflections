The visualization I chose can be found at https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/ng-interactive/2017/dec/20/bussed-out-america-moves-homeless-people-country-study

I chose this visualization because I was intruigued by the way it displayed three visualizations on a single geometry. I think displaying all three visualizations on one geometry makes for visually appealing transitions between them, and as a result, a better user experience. All three visualizations had to do with homeless relocation programs that give homeless people a chance to live in a different city, and used a map of the United States as geometry. I found the first of these interesting because of how it shows the lengths that some homeless travel during these programs. It only consists of a slowly moving line, which is effective because the audience is left in suspense about the total length of the line. The audience has no expectations about the length of the line at first, and then is surprised to see that the line stretches for more than half of the United States. I found the third of these three visualizations the most interesting. It firstly displays the cities with the most homeless people, and then displays the locations that most homeless end up in after a homeless relocation program. After showing the cities in the form of circles, the visualization displays trailing marks coming out of the circles that travel to locations that homeless people are relocated to. The locations that are most frequently traveled to are shown using larger circles, and the sizes of these circles is mapped to the amount of homeless people that travel to the location. I think this is an effective visualization because the trailing marks help to indicate both the large number of people that enter the relocation program and also the number of homeless that travel to certain locations.
