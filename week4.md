This is Week 4
I would likt to reflect on https://arvr.google.com/earth/ which google earth VR application.
In this application the users can visualize the map in a 3D view with 3 different mode: "Walk Around", "Fly", and "Browse"
By controling the direction of the holding controlers the users can navigate to the desired position. On the map, the user can use the handler to click on 
the section of intrest and the detail information of that section of that region will be displayed on the side, and the user also can view the entire early by increaseing the 
viewing height.
I think the most powerful function of this application is the user can view all things in all different direction which is totally different from 2D map. 
I tried this application 5 month ago in NYC and it really impressed me; all the visulization is very similar to the real world and I can "fly" with this application, 
but it might not good for someone who has acrophobia lol
To quickly navigate to a far distination, users can click the home button
on one of the handler and a small earth animation will display above the handler. Then the user can use another handler to rotate the earth and nagivate to a differnt place.
All the 3D graphs in this application are generated from linear or non-linear transformation, and the coolest part of this application is that this visulization tool gives all the
controls to the users, and 3D space always contains more information than the 2D map.
Comparing to the traditional 2D maps, this application is more impressive more like an intertainment.
By using this visulization tool, we can travel to all different places without physically going there.

I am very interested in the rendering algorithm in this application. :)
