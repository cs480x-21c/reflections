This visualization shows the effects of Covid-19 on the unemployment rate in the united states. The thing I really enjoy about this is the use of space to show the sheer scale of changes to employment. This also avoids one of the traps of data visualizations, the fact that different axis scalings, can severly impact the perception of numbers. This is an important lesson to keep in mind, as different axes can often have major effects on perception, and one must be careful to keep this basic fact in mind when creating a visualization.
