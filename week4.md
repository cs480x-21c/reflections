Here, the NYT visualizes the challenges that the US is facing when distributing vacciness for COVID-19. Throughout the article, they visualize data in very different ways while trying to explain the same story, which was very interesting to see. 

The first one is a radar chart that visualizes the different challenges counties in the US are facing when distributing vaccines. They are categorized into five different categories: historic undervaccination, socioeconomic barriers, low health care resources, poor health care access, and irregular medical care. They came up with these five categories by looking at 28 indicators.

Then when you scroll down, you can see a cartogram (i believe that it's a non-overlapping non-contiguous cartogram) that has each state represented by their radial chartof vaccine preparedness. 

When you keep on scrolling down, it will show the all of the counties radial charts on top of each other so you can see how much they differ from each other in each state. Then, it shows the same radial charts but connects it to number of deaths by COVID-19, showing that they states with the highest difficulties typically have the higher death rates per 100k population. 

It highlights the states that are challenged the most, and connects it to anti-vax movements. Then, it shows how it's not just states in the south that are challenged by this. However, it does highlight Morris County in Texas, where it scored poorly in all ifce categories. 

Towards the end there are two more data visualizations. One that uses position on an unaligned scale, which compares how each category differs in urban and rural communities. Then, it shows a scatter plot that shows how states with larger minorities have lower health insurance coverage, which leads to people not going to the doctor's office because they can't affort it.
