# Food for thought

Inspired by Dear Data project, Emilia Ruzicka tries to learn more about herself and her habits. She decided to study/collected Data about a different topic.
The first four weeks, she studies her relationship with food. First, she tracked the times she ate. Then the following weeks, what she ate, conversation about food,
and lastly her thoughts of food. She offers four different visuals.

Pros
  - Four different visualizations showcasing four different topics
  - Week 2 visualization is my favorite. I especially like how the "scales" of enjoyment and satisfaction are incorporated into each plates viz - it looks very natural
  - Week 3 visualization resembles plates which goes with the overall theme of food

CONS
  - These are not the simplest of visualizations that cannot be understood without the legend
  - Week 2 is missing information about when was each meal had
  - Week 4 could have defined the dates of each meals
