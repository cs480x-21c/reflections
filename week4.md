### Week 4 Reflection -  Interaction Graph of Main Characters of the Office

I looked again on r/dataisbeautiful because all of the visualizations on there are super interesting and applicable to modern topics. 
This visualization was interesting to me, as the Office is one of my favorite shows and this visualization is super interesting to me.

I would categorize this under the "Present" data visualization type. One thing that I have to say is that this chart could have had more defining features
such as color coordination per character, or a different way of presenting this data as it is a bit confusing to look at.
