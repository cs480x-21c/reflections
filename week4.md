Data vis – 
https://www.reddit.com/r/dataisbeautiful/comments/lsezc8/confirmed_covid19_cases_in_finland_over_time_oc/

This visualization shows COVID-19 cases in Finland over the past year. The time aspect of this vis is really cool to see as almost an explosion of cases arise from what seems life very few. Since some areas may have a lower population to area, the amount of color may be misleading if one does not take into account the intensity. The title in the vis is also a bit misleading as it reads “cases in Finland in the last seven days”. The timeline spans the entire year, but each day showcases cases from the past seven. One thing that would clear this up would just be to place the date next to this line rather than at the bottom, “2020-08-23. cases in Finland in last seven days”.
