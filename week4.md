This vis is a animation showing a sort of cross-section of the earth and the elevation of the surface for each degree of latitude. Overall, it's an interesting vis, but I think it could be improved on.

I think it would be really interesting to have labels on it, or occasionally pause to point out certain spots. For example, labels could show what continents you're looking at on the lower half of the screen, or the animation could pause to point out things like Mt. Everest, or the Marianna Trench.

I also think that the data is presented a bit strangely, as the cross-section is compressed horizontaly so much that the surface just looks spiky. I think that making the vis wider, and maybe lowering the scale of the heights/depths would make it look a bit nicer.
