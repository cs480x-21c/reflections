This week I chose this video from [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/dataisbeautiful/comments/lulc9h/interaction_graph_of_18_characters_in_the_office/). I chose this visualization because it is a very intersting way to display the data. As someone who also likes the office it was an intersting way to see this type of data being displayed as almost some kind of globe with lines connecting all the characters and the lines thickness dictates how often theses people interacted. I found this as a very intersting way someone could have chosen the data. A more conventional way this data could have been displayed might have been time spent with other characters and within each pillar, it has an internal color breackdown for each character that they had talked too. This way you can present the data potentially in a cleaner way although it would mean that you have a larger legend within the graph for marking which color represents which character... this could be ineffective.

Another thing that I noticed within the comments is that the data displayed on this visualization is skewed, so it doesnt capture all the intereactions between characteres within the show. This is importatnt to note because something like this might have been chose for stylization decsions, almost like omitting an outlier point. Where interactions were so small that it would be pointless to display in the visualzation besides just creating more clutter. Same being said where maybe some interactions were omitted so lines we not as thick. Overall, I like this visualization and it is a very creative way to display the data that they chose.
