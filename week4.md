# Reflection - Week 4

This week for my reflection I have chosen a visualization that is very near and dear to my heart for all the wrong reasons. I have chosen a graph
of the corona virus outbreak, specifically, the one from NBC news. I have been checking this graph everyday since NBC news first put it out,
almost a year ago on March 12th, which says something about the staying power of the graph. 

The graph is incredibly simple, however, that is what appeals to me the most, I have seen countless graphics of COVID data, but the simple NBC graph
has stayed as my favorite. That being said, it does have some problems. As the year has gone by, it has gotten harder and harder to distinguish the 
bars, each bar represents one day so it has gotten very crowded very fast. Additionally, the graph used to have some interactivity, however the bars 
have gotten so skinny and indistinquishable that is no longer supported. A good addition to the graph would be the ability to zoom in, or possibly
select bars using the arrow keys, because I miss the interactivity.
