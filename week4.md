# Reflection: [Key Workers | Migrants' contribution to the COVID-19 response](https://www.odi.org/migrant-key-workers-covid-19/)

I found this visualization when I was accidentally redirected away from my previous week visualization's website. This page is also hosted by ODI, the Overseas Development Institute. Similarly to the previous visualization I highlighted, this viz also focuses on a dataset related to migrant workers. This is a bit of a different visualization than others that I've looked at before; there really isn't any data analysis being done.  
The main page of the viz shows a separate tree for each continent. Within each of those trees are a couple of main branches, each representing different sectors like healthcare and agriculture. The sub-branches represent "levels of action, from the national to the local". The main page of each tree shows a map of the continent on the right side, with the locations of each leaf pinned on the map. 
The map is not interactive, which is a complaint I have. You have to interact with the filters below the map or select a leaf node from the tree on the left. Another complaint I have is that the tooltip showing the event name when you hover over the tree only lists the name; I think it would have been very helpful to list the sector and level of action with the name, or to allow the user to have a tooltip related to sector and level of action for the tree's branches instead of just for the nodes.  
Each leaf at the end of a branch opens a page documenting the event the leaf corresponds to. It shows a map of the country where the event took place, with the region pinpointed. This detail panel also lists the date the leaf occurred, the sector and the level of action it belongs to.  
I think the information in this viz is very cool and the fact that its data source is continually updated is pretty cool, as it keeps it timely as Covid continues to prompt changes in business and governance. Additionally, the writeups provided in the leaf detail panels is nice and succint, and some nodes have some more explanation or more minor visualizations supporting them, which are both nice details.
