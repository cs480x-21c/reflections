Vis: https://www.reddit.com/r/dataisbeautiful/comments/lu9tp6/hours_of_daylight_around_the_world_as_the_year/

A bit late on this one.

I thought this vis does a good job showing hours of day light. I have always known about this happening,
but I have never seen anyone visualize how the daylight changes through the year.
I like the color scheme that is used. It is meant to be a diverging color scale. 
Instead of just using monochrome, they used colors to clearly show both
the extremes and the transition from low hours to high hours of daylight.
I like the one year clock, it helps show where we are through the year.

The only problem with this vis for me, is the map can look a bit hazy. 
We know that the shift in daylight is caused by the earth's tilt, so I am not sure why the vis does not mention that.
I think the year clock could be changed to show exactly how the earth goes around the sun (heavily simplified) 
where it starts and ends during the year, and clearly show the earth's tilt.
