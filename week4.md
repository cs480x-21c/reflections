This is a link to a map tracking SARS-CoV-2 tramission and strains. You can follow the animations to see where COVID has spread. You can also track the transmission of specific strains over time and add transimission lines to see where the first case in a region was transmitted from (based on sequencing of the virus)

I thought this was interesting, especially as we are starting to see new strains pop up, and I haven't really looked at a map like this since Italy entered their first lockdown. 

This also goes a little bit into what we were talking about last week about maps, and what our assignment 4 is about multiple views.
