This vis is not the most interactive, but I found it to be rather interesting. From the end of 2019 to 2020, Hong Kong was pretty much the main headline for many reasons, the main one being the protests. This vis gives you a cool way to look through the year and see each major event along with a journal tied to it. I decided to choose this vis because this is the best way I've ever seen this type of data presented. They have a easy to navigate timeline with a picture and blurb about each story so you can decided whether or not you want to click on it to read more. This also helps give you some context to the protests, everyone knew the main idea of the Hong Kong protests, but to really get an on the ground understand of how they are feeling, you need the context behind the situation.
