# Reflection - Week 4

For this weekâ€™s reflection, I found the website,[ NBA Shots](https://tabsoft.co/2WeLhoZ), which visualizes where on the backboard NBA players/teams are likely to hit when taking a shot. This is achieved through generating a heat map based upon the collection of data where the ball has previously hit the backboard and then overlaying it over an illustration of a backboard. There are several options that alter how and what data is displayed. The visual style of the heatmap can be toggled between a set number of alternative modes. By mousing over a spot on the chart, additional information, such as the number of shots made at that point, are revealed. In addition, the user can choose to display every year's worth of data recorded all at once or only one year at a time. In terms of the data shown, the user has the choice of viewing the data of an individual player or the cumulative data of an entire team. The user can either select from a drop down menu or search for a particular player or team using the search box. Certain data can be filtered out, including from which part of the season the shots are taken from.

A major flaw of the site it's speed to load or refresh. Whenever a new option is selected, the site will take a while before it updates with the new graphics. This may be due to the site running off of the web version of the program "Tableau". Running it locally may improve performance. However, this is still a major flaw, as having a great web version improves the reach the site has, as well as, the overall user experience. Besides the performance flaw, the site overall has great visuals and discoverability options that assist the user in experiencing the site.
