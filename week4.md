# Overview

The visualization that I chose to look at this week is a simple little online visualization where you can draw an iceberg and see how it floats, called [Iceberger](https://joshdata.me/iceberger.html). This visualization was created by Joshu Tauberer, who is also known for creating GovTrack. I saw this visualization last week on the front page of Hacker News and thought it was interesting.

# Background

To interact with the visualization, you simle click and drag to draw a shape. Once the mouse has been released, a closed shape is generated from your path that you have drawn. The visualization then simulates roughly how an iceberg with that shape might float. It is particularly interesting to see how little of an iceberg floats above the water. I think that everyone is kind of familiar with that concept, but it's only about 10% of the iceberg!

# Conclusion

This visualization is a good example of an exploratory visualization, albeit not one really serving any purpose. It is, however, enjoyable to interact with. Iceberger may be simple, but I don't really think that is a mark against it because its purpose was also very simple.
