This visualization is showing migration in and out of states and counties in the US.
Areas that have negative migration (more people leaving) are colored orange while areas with positive migration are colored purple.
There is the option to change the decade from the 2000s all the way back to the 1950s.
You can also filter the migration by different age ranges as well as white, black, or hispanic migration rates.
The visualization also has different tabs where you can look at the data in a line chart and compare and contrast how migration is different between those different counties or states.
Looking at the data, you can see many interesting trends.
In the 50s and 60s, there is a lot of mass migration from more rural areas to urban areas with most of the map colored orange.
In the 70s there is a lot more migration to rural areas, and in the 80s, the migration to urban areas returns.
Throughout most of the time periods, you can see that there is migration away from the middle of the country.
It is also pretty interesting to see that in the 2000s some of the most populated urban centers (SF, LA, NYC) have negative migration with people likely leaving due to increasing living costs.
Recently, there has also been a lot more migration to southern states like florida and texas as well as to some states on the west coast like oregon and washington.
