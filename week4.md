Here is the link for an animated data visualization of World
Immigrant Map: http://metrocosm.com/global-migration-map.html

In this map, there are circles that are either large or small, 
representing areas or countries. There are two colors of the
circles: blue and red. By analyzing the moving trend and the color
of the circles, we may conclude that blue represents the areas
that have a positive net population growth. This implies that
there are more immigrants moving in rather than people moving out.
The red circles represent there are more people moving out rather than
moving in. There are also lines connecting the areas and countries. It
 represents where those immigrants are coming from or going to. There 
are also many minimal dots moving on the map to simulate the movement trend. 
In conclusion, there are a lot of immigrants moving to Canada, 
U.S., north Europe, South Africa, Russia and New Zealand, while there
are more people moving out rather than moving in in east Europe and
Asia. The colors and shapes of this map is attractive, making
 the map a good tool to analyze the immigrant trend.
