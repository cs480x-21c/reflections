Week 4 Reflection: US Military Footprint https://a.flow.gl/#/flow/kljr3zx7

This visualization is an interactive map displaying The United States' military bases around the world. By default, this is laid out as a 3d globe with color coded dots placed in their respective locations around the world. Hovering over each dot, you may find more information about the specific military installation/activity. You can also view the data as a list of country names with a series of dots beside each time. This form is more useful for comparing countries to each other with respect to US military presence. They are ordered such that countries with a greater military presence are closer to each other in the list. The final form of this visualization is a two dimensional map with dots once again in their respective locations. I found this form to be a good way to view all of the data at once. The visualization animates it's transformations from one form to another. I really enjoyed the variety of forms this vis took to display the same data. Each form is better for differing uses of the data. I considered the globe to excel in the purpose of exploring the data, while the list was better for comparing counties, and the 2d map was best for looking at all of the data at once as a whole. I enjoyed how bases in the same area were represented with dots stacked upon each other. It made locations with heavy military presence stand out. My biggest complaint was a lack of definitions for the key, as I am unfamiliar with the terms and the differences between them.
