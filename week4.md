# Writeup
This chart was created by a reddit user with raster and ggplot packages from R. They animated the chart using ffmpeg. The chart displays a still map of the northern hemisphere of Earth. A translucent layer of the southern hemisphere is animated sliding accross the northern hemisphere. The plot compares the latitude of places in northern and southern hemispheres. This gives a great perspective for comparing the distance of locations from the equator. Eyeballing those distances is very difficult. 
By animating the plot, tons of comparisons can be easily made, while still on a 2d visualization. Having access to drag the moving layer around and easily pause on locations of desire would make this even more useful. This method could also be used to compare various types of bar plots.
