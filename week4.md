This visualization shows the percentage of teachers in Singapore with different categories of experience for every year from 1987 to 2019. It conveys a ton of information in a relatively small space, and overall is a decent example of an alternative way to use stacked bar graphs. On top of that, the colors are consistent and their values have meaning and vary in such a way that someone who cannot see blue would still be able to tell the difference.

Another form this information could have been presented is a series of pie charts, although I wouldn't really personally recommend it.

I think I would actually reverse the order of the bars to make it even easier to process. Technically, all the teachers have had 0-4 years of service, so the stacking is more cumulative. I would also add more tick marks to make it easier to estimate percentages for all the data points.

It would also be nice to have an interactive piece to this visualization - perhaps hovering over a bar gave more information, such as degrees of the teachers in that category, or the exact percentage or count.
