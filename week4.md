This week, I will be reflecting on a visualization showing Google Trends data for Chess and the release of the popular Netflix film "The Queen's Gambit".

This viz interests me because, as a Chess enthusiast myself, I noticed more recently that whenever I tell people I play Chess, they more frequently follow-up by asking me if I have watched The Queen's Gambit (which, I still haven't yet). Data from multiple sources seem to indicate that Chess has recently exploded in popularity on platforms such as Twitch.tv and YouTube. Chess.com, (pretty much the most popular chess website on the Internet) reported a record number of registrations after the release of The Queen's Gambit. One thing that is still unclear is how much the COVID-19 pandemic affected Chess and its rise in popularity.
