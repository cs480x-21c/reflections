The visualization I chose can be found at https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/interactive-budget.

I chose this visualization because it represents data in a structure that I haven't seen before, and I found it quite useful for educational purposes. The visualization is meant to display the US government's budget in 2016 and its constituents. It achieves this by representing each component of the budget as a box. Inside each box are smaller boxes representing the sub-components of a budget item. The boxes' sizes are proportional to the amount of money they represent. I think this is an intuitive way of showing not only how the budget is made up, but also how each component of the budget is made up. This visualization's interactions also help to serve its aim to educate about the budget. Users can hover over each box to view the precise amount of money budgeted to each component of the budget. They can also click on a component to either change the view to contain only that component, or display a description of a component. I think this is useful because it allows the user to gain a more precise understanding of the sub-categories within a category, or to learn the meaning of a component. The only fault I see in this visualization is that to zoom out of a component, the user has to click a button outside of the visualization. I think it would be a better idea to let the user do this by clicking inside the visualization instead, as I think it would contribute to a better user experience.
