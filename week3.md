Week 3 Reflection: Visualizing All of Earth’s Satellites: Who Owns Our Orbit?

---

For this week's reflection, I chose a [visualization](https://www.visualcapitalist.com/visualizing-all-of-earths-satellites/) from Visual Capitalist.
I chose this visualization because I think it creatively shows how many satellites are in Earth’s orbit and how many are operational vs how many are junk. I think this type of visualization is great for enjoying the data because of how this visualization can tell a story and be easy to understand. The visualization includes multiple captions to help identify the type/purpose of the satellite. There is also a key to help viewers read the chart. It is labeled that 1 dot is equivalent to 10 satellites. It was interesting to see that more than half of all operational satellites are launched for commercial purposes. The bottom of the visualization includes horizontal bar charts to present the purpose of the satellites. The sources of the data is The Union of Concerned Scientists, Business Insider, Euroconsult, and the European Space Agency. The creator indicates a projection that there may be an average of 990 satellites launched yearly by 2028. Below the visualization are numerous other charts and tables that present the data. One interesting chart is the Countries that Dominate Earth’s Orbit, where it shows that the United States has about 49% of the operational satellites.
