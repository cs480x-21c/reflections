Visualization: https://www.reddit.com/r/dataisbeautiful/comments/loj0sz/this_is_a_timelapse_of_covids_impact_on_google/

This visualization caught my attention because it was related to covid but was an apsect of covid's effect on society that was relatively "non-tradition" in relation to a lot of datasets and data visualizations that are out there. This visualization shows the impact of different categories of popular search terms on Google during different parts of the pandemic. It's an animated visualization, showing the change in popularity of searches related to parks, retail and recreation, workplaces, and deaths. Especially interesting is the fact that is also breaks these trends up by the states in the United States. I thought this was really interesting because it provides insight of how the different phases of the pandemic affected different geographic areas at different times. 
Clear phases of the pademic are evident. At the start, there is a sharp decline in searches related to workplaces, retail and recreation and parks as the preliminary lockdowns were put into place. Meanwhile searches related to deaths went up. Then, as summer began searches related to park and recreation increased and deaths decreased. As the fall approached, more searches related to workplaces began to show up, however focusing on very particular states (potentially states that opened up sooner than others)? Then, going into winter searches related to parks and outdoor activities plummeted while searches related to deaths went up again.
I thought the animated/timelapse part of the visualization was overall pretty well executed, although a bit long to get through the entire timeline. The creator of the visualization broke it down day-by-day. I might have chosen a longer interval to create an overall shorter and less tedious animation. I might have also chosen a color scheme that makes more sense, as the creator tried to use a quantitative scale that involved different hues (red and blue). I would have chosen a single color, just changing the saturation to reflect more/less search activitiy.
