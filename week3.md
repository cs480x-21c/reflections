**Adrian Orszulak's Week 3 Reflection**

Summary and Description
===
The visualization, while originally retrieved from the visme.co website, was published by the CarbonBrief organization. The author is Antti Lipponen, who created this data visualization using data from NASA GISS, GISTEMP LOTI, ERSSTv5, 1200km smoothing. The data visualization displays the temperature anomalies for a select number of countries from 1880 to 2017. A positive temperature difference is represented by a more red circle over the country name whereas a negative temperature difference is represented by a more blue circle over the country name. Over the course of the data visualization, countries shift between temperature differences rapidly. However, torwards the end of the visualization, there is a distinct and more red trend between all countries. At the end of the visualization,the tempearture difference in 2017 is revealed for each country. Given the mission of the CarbonBrief organization, this data visualization is made for presentation. The data visualization is meant to show that there is definitely an increase in temperatures globaly caused by climate change. This conclusion is supported by the end of the visualization, which indicates the temperature differences of all countries to be positive and, therefore, red. 

The data visualization is comprised of table set data. The attributes of this table set data is qualitative. The data is represented as both the color and the size of the circle. The size of the circle is tied to the magnitude of the qualitative data i.e. the greater the value, the larger the circle. The color of the circle is tied to whether the data is positive (more red) or negative (more blue), and the magnitude of the qualitative data in on a divergent scale from 0. 

Improvements moving forward
===
There are two aspects to this data visuliation that should be addressed: the amount of data and the overlap of data. Firstly, there is a lot of data and information that is being displayed on the screen all at once. Though useful in presenting the trend about climate change, this can be overwhelming. Cutting back on some of the data may be a useful edit. Secondly, there is some overlap between the data points such that names of countries and some circles are covered by other circles. Increasing the spacing between points or adding some opacity to the representative circles could help mitigate this in the future.
