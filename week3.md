I like this pie chart because it was very interesting to see what kind of things a child would tell their parent. It made me ask my parents the kinds of things I asked as a kid which led to some interesting discussions. Anyways, there is a nice distribution of colors, and I really like how the shade of colors can indicate different data points yet still be part of a collection such as “facts”. I’ve seen some pie charts that use braces or outlines to differentiate between categories, so using different shades of the same color was not something that immediately came to mind, but was a nice refresher on the possibilities. After reading further into the comments the original poster commented that his son was 6 years old at the time.
