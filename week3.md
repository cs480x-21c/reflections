This data vis shows the percentage of people in America in each age group, from 0-4 all the way to 85+. Since the beginning of time, this graph would always look like a pyramid whenever it was created for any civilization. Recently, this has changed, due to the increase in life expectancy from modern science, the pyramid is becoming a rectangle. This has already happening in America, the population of the older half of the country is increasing. While this isn't true for every country on the planet, other countries it's even more extreme. Take Japan for example, they have a negative birth rate, and lots of eldery. This causes a graph of their population to already look a lot more like a rectangle. 

This graph lets you jump ahead in time to look at what our population should look like in the near future. By 2060, the amount of elderly (85+) will equal the amount of newborns (0-4).
