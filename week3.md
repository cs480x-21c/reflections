This is a set of three simple graphs showing the age distribution of members of the senate and house of representatives in america. I think it's fairly concerning how unbalanced it is, and how little representation people my age have.

In terms of design, however, I think a few improvements could be made to the charts. Throughout all three graphs, I think that the text is a bit too small. I can read it without zooming in, but just barely. For a graph this simple, it'd be better to scale the text up a bit, so that it would be easy for anyone to read.

The graphs that show the senate and house seperately could be combined, although since the house has more seats than the senate, the Y axis would have to be proportional, and not absolute. I think it might look nice to graph the two lines for one generation, and then shade in the area inbetween them.

This is more of a minor gripe than anything, but the three graphs have several inconsistencies. The spacing between the axes, margins, and sources arent kept consistent, which bugs me when I'm going back and forth between graphs.

Also, the graph for the house doesnt have a label for the Y axis, and the one for the senate has the Y axis just labeled as 'value', when it should really be labeled something like 'Number of seats occupied'.
