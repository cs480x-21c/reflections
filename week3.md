# NYT interactive vaccination map

This interactive map shows the percentage of population that has had the
COVID vaccine(one or two doses).
The viz can be changed for different options(ex. infection rates), but I focused on the USA vaccination numbers/article.


Pros
  - The map is interactive - hovering over different states gives more information about their specific vaccination percentage
  - The map can be altered to show the population vaccination percentage of at least 1 dose or 2 doses
  - The viz is topped with a dropdown option of seeing more COVID statistics for USA and rest of the world, which is very convenient.
  - The vaccination rate viz includes an article with different visualizations about other aspects of COVID vaccination campaign, such as availability,
  vaccination rate, and prognosis. 

Cons
  - The color scale is deceiving. It maxes out at around 14%. I think it would be better if the color scale was from 0 to 100. Seeing the dark colors on
  certain states tricks the eye into thinking that more progress has been made than just 14%.
  - Including an overall percentage marker for the whole country(as seen in state specific information when hovering over the states) would better present the progress that has been made.
