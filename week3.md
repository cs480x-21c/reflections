# Week 3 Reflection - Earth

[Earth - A Global Map of Wind, Weather, and Ocean Conditions](https://earth.nullschool.net/#2020/10/26/2100Z/particulates/surface/level/overlay=pm2.5/orthographic=-95.21,36.90,685/loc=-76.319,51.155)

This is a visualisation that interestingly my mom sent me and falls under the discover category.
The visualisation shows the Earth with a series of overlays to show movement throughout the planet.
You can select between Air, Ocean, Chem, Particulates, and Space. 
Each overlay mode then gives you a choice of animations, overlays, or other details based on the type.
The scale also changes based on what settings you choose to best illustrate the data.
The data that comprises this visualisation comes from a variety of sources. 
Weather conditions are forecasted and updated every three hours, ocean currents are estimated every five days,
ocean surface temperatures are based on a 30 year daily average and updated daily, ocean waves are updated every three hours,
and the aurora is update every half hour. 

Overall this visualisation is extremely intriguing to look at and play around with. It is packed full of detail, attention grabbing, and 
intuitive to use and understand.
