Reflection Week3

This week I would like to reflect the "worldometer" which is a big data visulization website.
The GUI design is not very fancy on this website but it is very easy to use and very convenience in which you always can find what you are looking for very fast.
One of the biggest role of this website is to report the Covid cases during this pandamic.
All the graphs on this website have three different views which are "daily", "linear" and "logarithmic".
The "Daily" plot is a bar chart in which the hight of each bar represents the cases in that specific date, and the users can view the detail information of that day by
moving their cursor on that bar, and the small label with detail information will appear.
The linear and logarithmic chart can give different information. On mathmatical side, the logarithmic graph is more impressive at the beginnig of this pandamic due to 
the geometric growth cases number.
Meanwhile, they also provide the table view for total cases, new cases, total deaths,total recoverd, and also daily information for each country. Users can rank this table
depends on different attributes. Each cell also color coded based on the growing rate. To view the detail for a country, users can click the name and the table view for that
specific country will be displayed.

There also some other data people can visualize on this website such as the world population.
In general, this is not a very fancy designed website but very user friendly and ez to use :). As we learned in class, the function always goes first!
