This week I chose the visualization that can be viewed here on [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/dataisbeautiful/comments/lot486/frequency_of_letters_in_english_words_and_where/). I found this data visualization paticularly interesting because it presents the data well as well as shows some intersting values that I don't think I would have anticipated as someone who speaks the English language. Seeing that the letter J is the lowest appearing letter in english words was shocking to me for sure, especially thinking that we have words such as "just" which appear to be used relatively frequently within the English language. Some of the information that is presented in this is also shocking to me where we can see J is the lowest over letters such as 'Z', 'Q' or 'X' which is something that I would not have assumed as I feel like people use words with J's much more than with those other letters.

I really like the way that this data is presented, each letter is given a corresponding bar chart. Within each bar chart we can see the heights of each line dictate the frequency of where the letter appears in the word. So not only is each letter given an overall percentage of how it appears, the frequency of where it appears within words is also shown within the bar charts. I think that this is a really good way to display the data as it is able to convey more than one piece of data about each element in a conventional way that does not create a ton of clutter on the screen and make it hard to follow. In addition to this, the nice use of colors to dictate the change in percentiles is also very indicitive of how drasticallty different some of these letters appear. With 'E' having the darkest of blues and being at 10.98% and then something like 'J' which is at 0.18% and has this paleish yellow color just to indicate how far off it is from E. The legeneds at the bottom are very basic but display the point well however I think that they could have been done in a more creative way. For example for the bar chart showing front to back, there could have been a number line rather than just shoving text onto the bar chart itself. That piece does seem a little cluttered.

Overall, I think that this is a very nice visualization to look at. For something with no interactive parts it conveys the data in a very good way.
