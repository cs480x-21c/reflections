# Reflection - Week 3

For this week’s reflection, I found the website,[ Runway Palette](https://artsexperiments.withgoogle.com/runwaypalette), which visualizes the color palettes of various runway outfits. The site simplifies photos of outfits by distilling them down to their basic colors. Using the generated color sets, the site creates a large collage of colored dots where each dot represents an individual color set. By clicking on a palette’s dot, a gallery of that palette’s outfits are displayed. The default view of the collage is two dimensional, however, an option is present that allows for the collage to be viewed in three dimensions. Additionally, the website also has a feature where the user can upload a photo. The site will then generate a palette from the photo and display outfits that use the same colors.

Overall, the site's discoverability options have several flaws. The methodology for arranging the palettes is unclear, while the palettes do go from dark to light as you move from left to right, overall it seems to be completely random and inconsistent. For example, there are several pockets of red palettes spread out throughout the entire collage that start and stop at seeming arbitrary points. This also affects the presentation of the site, as the chaos of the graphics leaves the whole collage looking cluttered and muddy. The discoverability, however, is partially saved by the ability to upload photos mentioned above. The ability to find outfits using any picture brings order to the chaos present in the rest of the site. Overall, the concept of the site and underlying technology is very interesting, however, the presentation and ordering of the presented data makes the end product miss the landing and prevents users from experiencing all it has to offer.
