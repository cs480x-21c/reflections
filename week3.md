This visualization is represents the fan data of six teams in the Bundesliga (German Football Competition), primarily the data for FC Bayern Munich. This takes into account the noise levels of 5 FC Bayern Munich games in their stadium, Allianz Arena. There are a lot of visualizations here:

1. The Social Echo: This compares the Fans' energy (noise level) in the stadium with the tweets over Twitter as a two separate line charts. In the match Bayern vs Dortmund, the tweets exceeded the fans' energy.
2. The Cresendo Travels all around the world: This compares the Twitter "volume" (Social Activity) of the fans from different parts of the world. This is compared using circular areas plotted and labelled by their respective country flags.
3. The Games: This leads to a whole new visualization which is labelled in the form of a stadium used to demonstrate the noise levels from each area using bars. There is also a grid attached at the bottom of this to skip into the important moments of the match such as a goal, booking or a disallowed goal and the respective noise bars over the stadium. The fans of different teams are labelled with different colors. This also points out to the area in the stadium where the respective majority of a team's fans are sitting.

The above three visualizations are done for all 5 matches and they some of them feature the exact sounds during the moments of the games.
