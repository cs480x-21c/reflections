Data vis - https://www.reddit.com/r/dataisbeautiful/comments/lop8nm/oc_hotspot_analysis_around_pier_76_new_york/

This data vis highlights taxi pickup hotspots around pier 76 in Manhattan New York. The vis in initially caught my attention because of how cool looking it was, however, it took me a while to grasp what I was really looking at. My first change to this visualization would be to increase the font size. As even with full screen I found my self leaning in order to read the fine print. There is also a lot of added information on the bottom left of the vis that I think really clutters up the space and shows information that may very well be important but should probably be its own visualization. I do think the use of categories in the present hotspots adds lots of cool information, though the sectors present on the map move bottom left to top right and this is confusing with their infrastructure representations presented with 1 starting top left and moving bottom right. Overall, I think this visualization has lots of cool elements, but there is a lot left out on the organization side that could tremendously help user readability.
