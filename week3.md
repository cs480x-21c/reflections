This visualization is comparing the elevation of Switzerland to the population data of Switzerland
In the visualization, you can clearly see that the elevation has an inverse/negative correlation to population.
This means that the areas of Switzerland that are higher in elevation have lower amounts of people living there.
Similarly, most of the population of Switzerland are living in lower elevation areas.
This makes a lot of sense, since it is a lot harder to build cities in mountainous areas.
The visualization uses a 3d visualization which works really well.
This works well because for the elevation, the visualization is exaggerated by 300x, which makes it really easy to see which areas are more mountainous.
Additionally, the color scheme is pretty nice.
For the elevation, higher areas are colored more lightly, while lower areas are darker.
Conversely, for the population the areas with lower population are shaded darker, while the areas with higher population are colored lighter.
