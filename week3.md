Vis: https://www.reddit.com/r/dataisbeautiful/comments/lps8ba/oc_algorithmically_organizing_a_social_network/
Library: https://github.com/shobrook/communities

This vis/library finds community structures in network graphs. The libary provides several algorithms such as the louvian method to detect communities.
The library provides visuaization and animation using matplot lib and networkx. 
Since the libary is highly specialized, you could build a vis with very little code. 

There are a few problems I have with the vis. I have no idea what these end groups are, sure I know the items are correlated,
but there should be some sort of key. The graph seems to missing an x axis, I think it is measuring algorithm time, but I am not sure.
