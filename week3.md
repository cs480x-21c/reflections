This week, I decided to look for the worst possible piece of data visualization I could find. There's obviously a lot to learn from amazing data vis, but sometimes it's important to go back to the basics and remember what we should never, ever do.

First and foremost, graphs with a broken axis should be indicated clearly to prevent misconceptions about the scale. This is a bit nitpicky, but definitely plays a role in the confusing perspective of the visualization.

The most obvious issue is that the icons of women are inappropriately scaled, thus giving the impression that a 5'5" woman's head is an inch long, while a 5'2" woman's head is half an inch long. If the icons were properly scaled so the feet all began at 0" (which is not visible from this particular view, but does not mean it does not exist), the viewer would have a better idea of what these heights mean without having to pause and think about the actual height difference between a 5'0" person and a 5'5" person. This issue isn't as prevalent with a bar graph where the bars are uniform all the way through. While it would be less visually interesting, it would be more accurate. Personally, I would choose to keep the icons, but fix the Y axis so there is no break.

Now, assuming all of the above did not apply and the size was wholly accurate, there are still some issues with the data and its presentation.

The particular data samples chosen aren't terrible, given they are mostly from different regions, but with the sheer size of the world's population it would be better to either pick countries with more geographical variation or just have a larger sample size. It is unclear why these countries were chosen.

Also, while the colors chosen make a decent palette aesthetically, they are confusing to look at. Why are Latvia & South Africa, Australia & Peru, and Scotland & India the same colors? At the very least, if it was just to make it easier to distinguish them, the creator could have made the colors form a pattern - which isn't necessarily advisable, but would at least give a reason. The lack of significance in the color severely detracts from the visualization, which might as well just be monochrome.

I would personally pick more countries to give a better representation of every region from every continent, and I would make the same continent the same color (which also means adding a legend to the side that indicates the continent).

Overall, this visualization was an absolute nightmare to look at, but I also got a good laugh and a good reflection on data vis from it. 2 out of 10 stars, find me a Latvian woman thanks.
