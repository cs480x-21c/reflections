![Data Vis Reflection 3](https://github.com/abell625/reflections/blob/master/DataVisReflection-3.png?raw=true)

This visualization shows different ways that people around the world write time and date. It's interesting to see visually what differences exist between, for example, the U.S. way of writing dates and times versus ISO 8601, which is an international standard for writing dates and times. Something that are interesting to note might be that East Asia uses a very close format to the ISO 8601 format, but adds in AM/PM in between the date and time. It's also interesting to see delimiters between day, month, and year. For example, the U.S. will use '/', Worldwide people will typically use '.', but ISO 8601 uses '-'. I feel that this visualization does a great job at explaining the data at ahnd, however it could be interesting to see if there are even more ways of displaying the data.
