For my third reflection, I reviewed what I think is my facorite ever vis- a 3d map of all of the MCU (Marvel Cinematic Universe)
I thought it best to examine it from a dimension reduction standpoint because of the material from this past week.

**Reflection**

First of all, the visualization is amazing to look at. It is visually appealing to click and look around everything. It groups nodes with more links together (I wish they published more on how they made this...) in an appealing way. It presents multiple ways to navigate around the visualization. 

**Navigation**

There are sooo many ways to get around in this vis. The highest level tab selects between characters and movies, so its not really navigation more of a selection of interest. After that, there are categories that each Marvel character can fit into. These categories are places in a bar at the top, and when you select one, it presents you with a filtered view. In this way the top bar is a filtering mechanism, as the vis itself can look quite cluttered. 

Now for the actual navigation around the full list. With a simple click and drag, you can rotate around the entire graph of characters. Right click is a pan, and mouse wheel is zoom. The most compelling part of this vis is when you click on one of the circles. 

A bar pops up on the side and gives a background of the character, telling the reader a bit about who they are, their status in the MCU, who they are played by in the movies, and a picture from one of the movie/shows they are in. Along the botton, and in the vis, are this characters links. They are organized by color, for example a green link means friend. This was a clever way to show a specific association and follows the rules we learned about in our book: this is a categorical list, so hue is a good choice for differentiating between different categories. It also highlights all the links to the current character and grays out ones that are not connected, allowing the user to easily pick out who is connected to the current character. 

**Motivation/Wrapping up**

I believe that this was made purely for fans to enjoy browsing the MCU characters, but it truly is an amazing vis.
