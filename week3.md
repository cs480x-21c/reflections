This visualization is a two and a half minute video about the most popular girl names in the United States compared to England from 1890-2019. The video cycles through each year
and the names adjust in popularity. It is interesting to see how the two countries compare. I only saw a couple of periods of times when the most popular names were the same 
for both countries. For example in 1890-1918 Mary was the most popular and in 2003 Emily was the most popular for both. Although the visualization was very interesting, I was 
confused why there were different colors for the names. The colors associated to names matched between the two countries but I was not sure why the colors were included in the 
first place. Some names had the exact same color as others, for example Mary and Margaret were both royal blue. I think if there are colors to be included, they should be different
for each name. I also think there could be some other changes to make the visualization better. For example, add some sort of axis to quantify the popularity of the names. The 
difference between the names can be guessed by the different size bars, but there is no reference to see how popular one name was over another. I also think it would be interesting
to add more countries to the visualization to compare more names.
