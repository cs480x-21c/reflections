This is a web-based visualization of molecules. You can select a protein and visualize its shape based on data about its amino acid residue. Depending on the residue, amino acids have different conformations and binding. Understanding protein structure is important for understanding binding and interactions. It can be difficult to visualize the structure just based on the residue, so this visualization grants the ability to see a 3-D and interactive image of any protein. 

Seeing the 3D version helps you see where binding sites are on the protein.
