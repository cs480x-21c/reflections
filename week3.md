This week I found this data visualization by the New York Times https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2021/02/19/climate/texas-storm-power-generation-charts.html

I initially was looking for the new york times front cover data visualization of the number of covid deaths in the United States since the first death was reported. However, I could not find an internet link for that (apart from a twitter picture). However, after exploring the new york times page, I found another visualization that was still very relevant to what is going on in the country today - the electricity shortage in Texas in the middle of a winter storm. 

Since the blackouts were first reported, there has been a massive amount of misinformation being reported - some coming from the governour of Texas himself. One of the first things he said was that this shortage was caused by the lack of wind and solar energy - and that the green new deal (which would support these types of energy), would be detremental for Texas.

The New York Times decided to do some fact checking on those statements and really understand why these blackouts were happening. In the visualiization, you can see that natural gas was the one that was hit the hardest by the storm, followed by wind and coal. Solar does not seem to be affected by the storm.

When you scroll down, the New York Times visualized in a horizontal bar graph what the texas energy grid's worst case scenario was, and what eneded up happening was twice as bad as their worst case scenario. There are many reasons as to why they were not prepared for the winter storm, but at the end of the day that is what is causing these massive energy shortages to keep on happening.
