### Week 3 Reflection - Mapping main roads of the World

I looked again on r/dataisbeautiful because all of the visualizations on there are super interesting and applicable to modern topics. 
This visualization was interesting to me, as I really like traveling and seeing the many roads of the world is super interesting.

With this map you can see the very populous regions of the world.
