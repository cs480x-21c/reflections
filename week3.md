This visualization is a 3d model of the tropopause and surface potential temperature of North America on Feb 15th, 2021 at 6 UTC. The tropopause (White portion of model) is the boundary between the troposphere and stratospere, according to wikipedia. [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tropopause#:~:text=The%20tropopause%20is%20the%20boundary,mi)%20over%20the%20polar%20regions.] The troposphere is the lowest portion of earths atmosphere, beginning at the surface of the earth. This model visualizes the variation in placement of the tropopause, depending on weather patterns.

By animating this model, we are able to learn much more than from a static model. From above, we can clearly see the weather patterns over the land. As we begin to see the land itself, we can clearly see the surface temperature, and how that affects the tropopause. We then are able to glimpse the entirety of the variation in altitude the troposause can start and end at. This clearly shows us that the layers of the atmosphere are not evenly stacked one ontop of another. 

Using color, animation, and three dimensions, this plot is able to clearly represent a massive amount of data and multiple variables. This practice can be used for many mapping visualizations, to increase the amount of possible variables to display. This could be used in simpler applications as well, such as for adding a Z axis within a line plot, to display a another variable, and allowing viewers to pan the visualization view.
