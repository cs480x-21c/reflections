visualization( https://www.statista.com/chart/amp/2203/the-worlds-deadliest-animals/ )

For this week, I selected a visualization that represents the world's deadliest animals in terms of average number of human deaths per year. This visualization sheds light on how long held perceptions of dangerous animals are often wrong in terms of the actual number of deaths they produce. Perhaps part of that is the nature of death that results from interaction with these animals - crocodiles, hoppos, lions, etc. often result in a rather gristly, graphic death directly from the animal. Meanwhile, moquitos and other insects are generally vectors for diseases. In addition to the numbers given, the visual representation of deaths through point size is an easy way to rapidly perceive different death tolls.

However, there are some things I would do to improve this visualization. Perhaps the first thing I would do would be to specify *why* there is an overlap between the human and mosquito sections. Is there some sort of interaction between mosquitos and humans that contribute to the same deaths? Or is this simply an issue of spacing and size of the visualization? If the latter is the case, the graphic should have been reorganized to allow for all elements to exist without overlap. Furthermore, I would have liked the ability to drill down in data - mosquitos are the most deadly, but the graphic does not give diseases they carry, unlike what they do for the Tsetse fly and Assassin bug.
