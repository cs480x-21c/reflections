This vizualization shows a 3d representation of a peice of mars. The data is given from NASA. It might be cordinate data and the ther person who created it used a geographic information system that was able to create a landscape from the given data. I like it because it even includes color and slight bumps on the ground to give you a realistic view of Mars.
