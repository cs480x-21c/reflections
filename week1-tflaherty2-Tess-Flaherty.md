# Week 1 Reflection

As a new person to the world of coding and data visualization, I don't know what constitutes a good vizualization. My background and interests lie with ecology and the environment. So when looking for vizualizations, I looked for ones concerning those topics. I found this visualization on reddit (https://www.reddit.com/r/dataisbeautiful/comments/ioot6z/oc_i_wrote_a_script_which_builds_the_face_of_an/). The creator used data from the WWF and used P5.js. This kind of visualization is excellent at sending a message about endangered animals and climate change because it shows the damage done to the species visually. Saying the amount of individuals in the species is easy but actually conceptualizing the number is difficult. 
I also found another visualization on tableau (https://public.tableau.com/profile/ravi.kumar.n#!/vizhome/NoSlowDowninClimateChangeMM2021W-03/MM2021W03). I appreciated the aesthetic of the visualization - the color choices were pretty and eyecatching to see the difference in each cell. I also liked the interactivity of it where you could hover over each cell to see the details of each data point.
