I typically find stream graphs to be kind of confusing and hard to interperet, but I think that this one just looks really nice. the white outlines make it much easier to differentiate between different items. It's also quite interesting to see how the person who made the graph played some games quite a bit over a shorter period of time, while some were played less over a longer period.

However, some of the labels are curved to fit the shape of the graph, which makes it a bit diffcult to read them.

Seeing this graph kind of makes me want to create my own, especially since some of the games on it are ones that I've played this year.
