This week's visualisation was found on r/dataisbeautiful.
This visualisation shows what tools Dataviz Professionals use.
At the top of the page is an opinion survey of how the professionals want to use their time in future roles.
Below that it shows how much their current time is spent on data visualisation.

The lower half of the page shows the most interesting part, what tools are actually used.
Using very distinctive and clear coloring scaled stacked bar charts are used to show the percent of time that professionals use each of tools and what for.
Purples and greens are showed to demonstrate the distribution of whether the tool is used for their job, freelance or both.
However it is not entirely clear to me what the difference between some categories are.
As the hights of the bars are being used to show the comparative percentages the width of the bars are used to show the total number of users of the given tool

Over all this chart is very compelling to look and shows good data.
However, it does fail when it comes to explaining exactly what is being shown in some cases.
