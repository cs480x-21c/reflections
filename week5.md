Here's how it works:

Every week, make an effort to explore the data visualization community
Everyone has their preferred way of finding out more about a topic. You probably already come across visualizations in your daily life, either through news or social media. If you already feel "plugged in" to the data-driven world, by all means use those as reflection material.

Sources
Following folks on Twitter (for some reason there are tons of datavis folks on Twitter)
Reading visualization news blogs like FiveThirtyEight and The Upshot
Diving into a domain of interest (biology, security, etc) and it's relation to visualization (see BioVis, VizSec for example)
Wikipedia
Reddit (/r/dataisbeautiful)
Stack Overflow (check the d3 and ggplot2 tags)
Academic / practitioner visualization blogs: eagereyes.org (he links to many others)
...and hundreds of other ways.


Before class, add a reflection on a writing of your choosing to the appropriate week in your fork of the repo
There are few requirements for the reflection. I ask that you aim for 10 sentences at minimum.

The form and overall length of the writing is up to you. This task is meant to give you the creative space for exploration in the the data viz world. Some suggestions about the kinds of refelctions we expect are agreements or disagreements with a paper or talk you find, a small introduction to a new visualization technique/technology that came out, improvements or future work for a visualization you find on a news website etc. I recommend including links so you can find the resources later on. You can make multiple entries if it suites you-- I could imagine calling on reflections as you generate ideas for your final project.
