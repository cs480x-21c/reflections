I found this data vis interesting because of the time of year that it came out. Of course, with spring arriving, it is one veryones mind. The data vis has an itneresting background but poor execution in my opinion. I think that the idea behind the map is really cool and it would be very interesting to see if the colors were more accurate. The colors that the author chose are a bit hard to distinguish, and some dont seem to map very well the the map from the legend. I am curious as to where the data for this came from as it seems to be drawn across county lines. Was it estimated, and just drawn as an average, or does each county actually report a "spring" and it happens to be uniform?
