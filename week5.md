This week I would likt to reflect on some d3 visualization example on visHub. https://vizhub.com/
This is a very useful website in terms of finding d3 visualization coding examples.
The interaction is a very important in data visualization and it can give a user a very comfortable using experience.
In this example: https://vizhub.com/Joker-tr/bba73a9ffbaa4c33bbc39a5b3be07116
The author uses the scatter plot and the linking view with barChart to represent the number of nuclear events in the last 100 years at different location for different countries. 
The linking view is a very powerful method because it can show the user the relationship between two or more data sets at the same time, 
and it also can be used in zooming in the data to show more details.
In this visualization, the author uses the total Nuclear Events as the y feild in barchart and the time as the x feild. The purpose of this visualization is represent
the number of Nuclear Events during a time on the world map.
We could see that the name of that country is color coded on the map and and the size of the circle is correspond to the Nuclear Events Magnitude.
By using the bar chart linking view we can visualize the distribution of Nucelar Events during a time.
On the top of this visulization tool we could see two drop down meues in which we ca choose the Purpose of Deployments and the Type of Deployments. Those feilds can filter
our existing data to smaller subsets and provide more detail information to the users.
Users also can clink on the circle to view the detail infromation such as the name, Year, Type, and magnitude.
In general, by using different type of visualization tools and combining them properly, we can give the users better using experience.
