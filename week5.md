Week 5 Reflection: Which Streaming Service Has the Most Subscriptions?

---
For this week's reflection, I chose a [visualization](https://www.visualcapitalist.com/which-streaming-service-has-the-most-subscriptions/) from Visual Capitalist that compares the number of subscriptions between various streaming services.  
I chose this visualization because I think it is interesting and presents the data in an eye catching way. The visualization is a circular bar chart that displays the subscription counts across various streaming services. There is a key that identifies if a bar on the chart is referring to a video, audio, audio/video, or a news streaming service. The largest streaming service in terms of subscriptions is Netflix, with 204 million subscriptions reported during Q4 of 2020. I think this chart type puts an emphasis on scale to visualize the difference in subscription counts, which I think is a straightforward way to display the differences between the various streaming services. The visualization also includes comments/small captions pointing to certain streaming services, often noting an important fact or clarification. In addition, I like how the visualization includes each serviceâ€™s logo to easily identify and distinguish the various services. I think it is interesting that the author includes news subscriptions in a visualization on streaming services. Though the author makes note that news publishers are employing the use of subscription-based economics. The article includes a table of the data used, and identifies the service, type of service (audio/video), and the subscribers reported in Q4 of 2020.
