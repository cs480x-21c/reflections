The visualization I am reflecting on is at https://old.reddit.com/r/dataisbeautiful/comments/lcunfb/gonorrhea_rates_by_county_in_california_oc/. I chose it because there are some qualities of this visualization that can serve to teach some lessons about using line charts. The visualization is a line chart showing the gonorrhea rates in California counties. Each line represents the gonorrhea rate in a specific county. In my opinion, this visualization has some faults that prevent it from effectively conveying all of its data. One fault is that San Francisco's rate overshadows the others' so much that their data can't be closely seen on the graph. The scale of the y axis causes the lines under San Francisco's line to be close to each other, making it harder to see their trends. In addition, the graph contains too many lines. The large amount of lines leads to a greater amount of visual clutter, making it hard to read the chart. In addition, some of the lines' colors are very similar to each other, which makes it difficult to tell them apart. Therefore, this visualization has taught me not to use too many lines in a line chart, and to ensure colors are perceptually separable whenever using color.
