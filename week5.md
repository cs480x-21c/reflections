Chosen vis: https://www.gapminder.org/tools/

I first encountered this in high school economics class, and from watching the TED talk of the projects creator. This tool helps visualize various economic development markers of countries over time, and is a very good way to view the effects of certain events in history such as the great depression or the world wars.

Using animation to show progress over time is a great way to show economic disparity and relative developmental progression between nations. Through this visualization the viewer is able to recognize many aspects of the data that would be difficult otherwise to see, such as the advantage of western nations, or the recoil effect of events. 

This tool also allows viewers to select their own data and watch it play out over time, and is both user friendly and very visually appealing.
