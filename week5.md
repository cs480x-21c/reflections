Visualization: https://www.reddit.com/r/dataisbeautiful/comments/lz11ph/oc_comparing_the_size_of_the_brunt_ice_shelf/

This visualization is attempting to put perspective on the size of an iceberg that's breaking away from Antartica. It does this by overlaying the size of the iceberg (to scale) on top of four major cities (New York, London, Paris, Hong Kong). In addition, it shows a map of the piece of Antartica itself and the crack that's forming in the ice (showing how the crack has been expanding over the past several months). I thought this was a really interesting and well done visualization for multiple reasons. I like how the visualization is structured and presented to try to make a point and tell a story. It's clear that the visualization is trying to draw attention to the effects that climate change is having on our polar regions, by presenting the iceberg with the size of metro areas that people are familiar with. In addition, I think the presentation (colors chosen, layout of the crack timeline, overlay of the boundaries) all looks very professional/well done and is easy to understand. As a complete aside, I also never realize how much smaller Paris is in comparison to other major cities like New York and London.
