This is a choropleth map of the US showing the vaccination rates of vaccines in the US. I don't love this map, I think that it could be remixed and improved. The color scale seems off. I think that they should have done a better job scaling the colors based on the maximum and minimum vaccination rates. I think that it would also be interesting to compare covid hospitalization rates within the last week.
