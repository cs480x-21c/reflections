### Week 5 Reflection -  Elevation Lines of Oahu, Hawaii

I looked again on r/dataisbeautiful because all of the visualizations on there are super interesting and applicable to modern topics. 
This visualization was interesting to me, as I did my IQP in Hawaii and have been really curious about their interesting climate since. 

I would categorize this under the "Present" data visualization type. The visualization immediately shows how the elevation lines have moved and where they are formed through an interactive visualization. I liked how this visualization was color coded and it's easy to look at the data with your eyes.
