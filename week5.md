This visualization has an unbelievable amount of data associated with it. Each dot on each country represents $100 million in exports. You are able to mouse over each individual dot to find out what product is being sold and sometimes it will specify to whom it is being sold. Furthermore, you can click on each country to get a rough idea of who their main buyers are with lines linking the countries. I think the representation of each dot is really well done, the countries with the largest amount of exports in comparison to their size are the brightest, the absolute brightest of course being China due to their unbelievable amount of exports. There are also a plethora of other options you can select to view the data differently. Looking at the bottom tab you are able to categorize by product type as well as being able to view all the exports in this arbitrary 3d visualization showing the links between countries. One final note, selecting the "country stack" option is by far my favorite as it turns this hard to read 3D globe into pretty much a bar chart, clearly showing the top exporters to be China, Germany, and the US.
