Week 5 Reflection: Tools of Dedicated Dataviz Professionals https://i.redd.it/h6c7ppi38ll61.png

This viz displays a stacked bar chart detailing the most popular tools used by dataviz professionals. There are several that are familiar from this course, including D3 which is the fourth most popular according to this viz. The viz itself provides a good list of tools that could be useful to learn. I found this viz a bit confusing in its use of both rectangle height and length. The way the vis was arranged, with the tools on the y-axis, I instinctively compared their lengths, and did not realize height was being used to provide more information. This graph could be misleading for some, as I had initially interpretted it as suggesting "58% of dataviz professionals use WebGL" when it actually means "58% of WebGL users have dataviz as their focus". With this graph layout, it would be difficult to determine which tools datavis professionals actually use most often. In this viz, it is also difficult to compare individual groups besides 'focus in job and freelancing' which is the base of the stacked bars. There could be benefits to making this graph interactive in a way that lets you reorder groups or choose which to display at a given time. One thing I liked about this viz, however, was the use of annotations to point out interesting trends. I found that they helped my understanding of the graph a lot, and they seem useful for visualizations with the intent to present.
