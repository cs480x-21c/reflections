This visualization is of how diets globally have changed in the past 50 years.
There are a lot of visualizations on this site about how diets have changed.
For these visualizations, they looked at the diet of 152 countries from 1961 to 2009.
On average, they found that national diets had become larger in all food type categories with oils having the largest increase.
For that visualization, you can click different food groups to filter them and look at how a specific food group (fruits/grains) have changed over time.
They also found that global diets have become more similar to each other as well as the most dominant foods in national diets have become less important.
The visualization also allows you to compare and contrast food trends in all of the countries involved in the study.
It was interesting to see what crops have become more popular and what crops have become less popular around the world.
It was interesting that sugar has not seen a relative uptick in popularity, and actually seen a slight decrease in the past 50 years.
Other crops like soybeans and palm oil on the other hand, have seen a significant relative uptick in popularity.
Comparing the diversity of diets in countries, you can see that countries such as the US and Canada which are relatively wealthy, have a lot more diversity in the foods that their citizens eat compared to less wealthy countries.
