For this week, I found a topological visualization of the Appalachian Trail - one of the longest continuous trails in the world. There are several aspects that I particularly enjoy in this visual. The grayscale color patter for elevation is rather easy to quickly discern differents in elevation as well as displaying how the Appalachian range is shaped. The golden color used to represent the trail itself is visually striking. 

The main reason why I chose this visualization is that this seems perfect for linked visualizations. This standalone visualization doesn't include too much information. I would love some interactivity, such as the ability to scroll over the trail to get elevation readings, latitude, and longitude. This is where a linked visual would be perfect. I would have a secondary visual that gives a gradient/elevation profile of the trail. As the user moves their mouse over either the profile or the trail map, a marker would move along both visuals to illustrate the location on the trail.
