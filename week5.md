This was a really cool visualization I found on tumblr. The full [scrolly-telling version of the viz/article](http://kristinhenry.github.io/StickersAndStamps/index.html) is posted on the author's website.  
The article was published at the end of 2020, after starting over the summer during the USPS funding crisis. I thought that the combination of analog "data", the letters being sent, being catalogued digitally was really cool.  
I really liked that the author combined a bunch of different types of static graphics with the animated map at the end of the article.  
The scrolly-telling presentation of the project on the website was really neat, with some very slick transitions in the map sectin showing different parts of the map. Those zoom transitions coupled with the off-sides captions about those regions added a lot to the experience.  
I also thought that it was nice that she included a scatterplot of the data from the earlier part of the experiment, and then another one right after to show the dataset's growth.  
The evolution of the scatterplot to the histogram to the dual-axis chart was also nice. The narration accompanying the evolving graphics was a cool insight into why she chose to make each type of chart as she went, what they illuminated and why she wanted different charts afterwords.  
I think that this was a very cool visualization project and the positivity that the author worked into her writing made me feel happy when I reached the end of the article.
