This visualization compares the coronavirus pandemic with other pandemics from the day of first death since the year 2000. It utilizes the horizontal bar chart idiom with the bar chart race animation in it. It compares the following diseases: 

- Ebola (2014)
- Ebola (2018)
- Measles (2011)
- Measles (2019)
- Cholera (2008)
- Cholera (2010)
- Swine Flu (2015)
- Swine Flu (2009)
- MERS (2012)
- Meningitis (2009)
- SARS (2002)
- COVID-19 (2020)

The bars are color-coded with the diseases of same type (ex. Ebola (2014) and Ebola (2018) have the same color). The race starts with Ebola (2014) on top for the first 10 days, then quickly gets overtaken by Cholera (2010) from day 11. Cholera (2010) dominates for 65 days with around 3500 deaths and then gets overtaken by the current COVID-19 Pandemic on the 67th day. This visualization limits itself to the first 100 days of the breakout of a pandemic. COVID-19 wins this bar race with a total of 88,457 deaths in 100 days. This visualization clearly compares the current pandemic with the others, some of which we might not have noticed because they weren't global. This proves that COVID-19 is the deadliest pandemic that broke (atleast after year 2000). The MERS pandemic of 2012 has only 1 death in the first 100 days and is the last on this bar chart race.
