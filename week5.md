This data visualization is an animated graph showing unemployment insurance claims over time from 1967 up until early 2020. The graph does an amazing job capturing the astonishing number of unemployment insurance claims by building up to the spike from covid and showing natural seasonality. This seasonality appears drastic at first, however after seeing the spike in 2020 the ups and downs look insignificant. There is not much else to the graph besides a simple red line and simple axes. The data is portrayed nicely when looking at it statically as it is separated by month. The 12 data points per year for just over 50 years makes for more than enough data to interpret the general trends of unemployment insurance claims. If I were to make this graph statically I would probably use some sort of 2D model to display the vast difference in proportion. If I were to use a 3D model then the volume could throw off perception since the proportions would be different than a 2D chart due to the third dimension adding complexity.
