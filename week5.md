This week, I will be reflecting on a visualization showing the openings of colleges and universities in the United States, starting with Harvard University in 1636 to 1979. (R + ggplot + gganimate)

I thought this vis was interesting because it very clearly shows a "migration" pattern of colleges working their way across the east into the central US, then suddenly appearing on the west coast. Some improvements that I think would be great is if the dots were color coded based on when the colleges were open (maybe a color scale of some sort?). Also one major but easy-to-miss detail - there are only 48 of the 50 states included here! (University of Alaska opened in 1922).
