# Reflection - Week 5

For this weekâ€™s reflection, I found the website,[ OneZoom](https://www.onezoom.org/life.html), which visualizes the evolution of life on Earth. This is visualized in the form of a tree where each branch represents a set of species. As you travel down the branch, the branch splits and the set of species becomes more specialized. Along the branches, leaves are used to denote a species and when it came into existence. By clicking on a leaf, a popup appears showing information on the species from multiple sources such as Wikipedia or the Encyclopedia of Life. The visualization is explored through zooming in and out to explore branches and clicking and dragging to move around. Additional control options, such as resetting the view back to the beginning, and zooming in and out are present as buttons on the bottom of the screen. Additionally, there is a search bar present at the top of the screen that allows the user to travel directly to a species of their choice. 

There are several ways in which the tree can shape itself. By default, the tree is set to render in a spiral shape, though several other shapes, such as a straight line or a more traditional node chart, are also present. At first, I had issues navigating the tree because zooming in and out of the spiral felt a little tricky. I thought this was just how I had to navigate the site, but some of my problems were solved thanks to these alternate shapes.

Overall, I do like this site despite the flaws with navigation. I think it nails the presentation. It really puts into scope how massive the scope of evolution is as you scroll more and more with seemingly no end. All of the tree shapes look nice and each provides their own advantages and disadvantages when it comes to navigation and representing data. The set up of the site allows for the user to discover new information they may not had even been looking for easily.
