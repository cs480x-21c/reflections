The data visualization that I chose for this week is [here](https://datacrayon.com/posts/statistics/data-is-beautiful/co-occurring-pokemon-types/). As someone who really likes pokemon and grew up with the game I found this visualization very appealing to look at. The visualization displays data in a very good way where within the circle, if you hover over the given type it will branch out to all the other respective types that possess a subtype with the primary type. For example when you hover over fire, it will draw lines out of the hovered type and connect them to any pokemon that posses the main type of fire and a subtype of any of the corresponding lines. What makes the visualization intersting is that if you hover over the line it will also show you the given pokemon that maintain these primary and subtypes.

While I like the color breakup per type just like they have it in the game pokemon, I think that there is a lot of clutter in this visualization. I say this because when you hover over the color line, the pokemon just appear in the middle, however I think it would look a lot better if it was to appear on the side next to it as a list. While none of these lists are super extensive pokemon wise, it is important to note that this list is from generations 1 to generation 8 which means this contains all 898 pokemon. 

If I had to change this visualization in any way I would maintain the current pie chart with the type selection but I would move the data that getes displayed to the side or another part of the screen to avoid some of the clutter.
