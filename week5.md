Link to website Pudding's Best Year in Music visualization: https://pudding.cool/projects/music-history/

This website goes through Billboard's Top 5 Hits through the years from 1960 to 2019. It shows a line graph at a unique angle. The singers images shift as the songs change over time and follow the different paths. The images are underlined with a color based on which spot the song is in: white/yellow is #1, orange is #2, red/pink is #3, purple for #4, and purple/blue for #5. There is a timeline on the right side of the screen that allows you to scroll to any year. The songs that are repeat hits for more than one week will have the length of their number one spot next to the "1" under the song title. For example, Despacito is number 1 in 2017 for 4 weeks. Although the data is extremely interesting and fun to follow, it can be difficult to see what is coming next by the way the visualization is formatted. I think if the lines were perpendicular to the screen it would be easier to see the lines over time. I also think it would be useful if there was a feature to show lines throughout the whole time period and get an overview of the decades.
