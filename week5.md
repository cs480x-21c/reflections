This vizualization is an analgamation of many other vizualizations that are specific to the game minecraft. They show alot of intersting data that one would not be able to track. The gathering of the data must be interesting because it tracks all sorts of information. For example, not only how many deaths a player has, but also what caused those deaths. And all of this data is over an entire session of minecraft.
