Education is quite important for a country. Many countries spend
a large portion of revenue on it, and so does U.S.. Here is a 
data visualization about the average percentage of population
who own a bachelar or higher in different aras in U.S.. From the
vis we can know that it mainly count for 4 regions: Northeast, 
West, Midwest and South. The legend tells us that the bars with 
different colors represent different years, which range from 2005
to 2019. Continuously the education rate is growing, for example, 
in South it grows from 16.8% to 19.7%. Among the four regions, 
Northeast has the highest education rate. West is the second highest,
but the lowest rate in Northeast, 25.6% in 2005-2009, is even
higher than the highest rate in West, 25.4. Therefore, there is 
an extremely uneven education distribution in U.S.. This is 
a vis that is worth of taking a look at by the experts. The experts
may be able to study the reason behind the different education
rate in U.S. and think of a way to avoid it with the aid of the vis.
