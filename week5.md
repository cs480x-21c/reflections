### Description
The data viz presented here is a size comparison chart that looks at understanding how big and small certain objects are 
relative to each other. After taking some time to review the visualization there are some interesting things to note about it - 
something I learned was that there was a unit known as the fentometer (1 quadrillionth of a meter) and on the opposite side of 
the spectrum the light year is the largest unit by which we can measure. The light year unit I found quite surprising because
I was unaware that it could be used a measure of size, I had always thought it was a measure of distance. I would also
like to note some cool features related to the infographic, one is the tooltip related to each of the "objects" in question. 
It was helpful to get the chance to read a bit more about the topic and learn some cool insider information. One feature
I was not a fan of included the scrolling mechanism. I thought it would have been more helpful to have some way to control the
feature as there was a lot of deadspace (which gave an effect for size difference) between certain size categories. Overall however, 
this data visualization was incredibly helpful for understanding just how small and how big some things in our universe are.
