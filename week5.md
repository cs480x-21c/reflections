Vis: https://www.reddit.com/r/dataisbeautiful/comments/lzohca/tools_of_dedicated_dataviz_professionals_oc/

Found this vis to be interesting sice I did not know what tools data vis professionals used exactly. 
Looking at this chart gives me quite a few tools I could try that I have never used such as Mapbox.
I like the seperation between job roles, it shows where people are using the tools.
I have never seen this chart type before, I am not sure what it is called, but it clearly shows the percentage of job focus. 
I do not see an easy way to judge how many people are using a particular tool, some bar thickness are close in size.
The bar thickness also skews the y bar labels, there are some lines to show the name for each bar to aid in perception, but I still have to look over there to follow the line.
OP could have changed the range on the thickness so the names could line up better.

The vis combines multiple high-level explanations before showing the data, so it makes the chart easier to understand.
The writing also helps explain the data, and what is included in the data set.
I think the custom annoations help show some of the hidden detail, especially for the "Online tools" category.
