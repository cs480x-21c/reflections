# Overview
The visualization that I decided to reflect on this week is LeoLabs' low earth orbit visualization found [here](https://platform.leolabs.space/visualization). This visualization shows objects in low earth orbit. Objects are tagged by their name, catalog number, and orbit characteristics. The user can search for objects by their name. Additionally, the user can cycle through a number of views: last tracked, perigee, period, inclination, country of origin, and object type. Finally, the user can filter the viewed objects by the same criteria that the views sort them by.
 
# Background
LeoLabs is a company that offers tracking of objects in low earth orbit commercially to other companies and organizations, for purposes such as monitoring and collision avoidance. This visualization essentially serves as a demonstration of their capabilities. There isn't much information on how this visualization was made, but it seems to be using WebGL and is drawing on data collected by LeoLabs.

# Conclusion

This visualization is another good example of an exploratory visualization. It is a very easily navigable view of everything in low earth orbit, and if you think about it, it condenses a lot of information into relatively little visual complexity. Additionally, it does have a fair bit of depth to it in how the interactive features allow you to manipulate what you are viewing.
