# UK Government Incomes and Outgoings

Pros

  - Having a flow in the visualization: the incoming budget at the top that connects/flows down to the outgoings
  - Overall color theme - incomings a brown shades and outgoings a teal shades (more in cons)
  - Same/Similar colored sectors are separated by darker shades to make sure they are considered as different entities (more in cons)
  - Each category has a percentage indicator

Cons/Improvements

  - The different sectors should be in more contrasting colors. Social Systems/Education/Public Service are the same color
  - Hard to see the scale of budgets - hard to compare the size difference
  - Nice to see overall color scheme (different color for incomings and outgoings) but brown and teal are not a good combination
  - The graphic is too large, so it requires a lot of scrolling - which makes it hard to compare different sectors
  - it would be nice to have a total number for outgoings as well - have a teal half circle completing the brown half circle in the middle of viz to have better flow
  - Unclear what the sum near each category/sub-category stands for in outgoings section (assuming money spent per capita)
  - The year of the budget is not specified anywhere on the viz
  - Overall, this graphic is for very high level information, not meant to be the primary source of information
