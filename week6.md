This visualization is a moving bar chart that shows the number of vaccainations over time per country. It starts at the beginning of January and stops on March 13th (yesterday). China and the United States start at the beginning competing for the most vaccinations. The United States is at the top for almost all of the video but there are fluctuations between the difference between China and the United States. It is also interesting to see the countries towards the bottom of the chart and how they vary in ranking. Some countries fall off the list and then jump back on while others continue a steady pace in their positions. I think this visualization could be improved if there was some indicator of how many vaccinations were done in relation to population size. I also think the visualization could be improved if the colors of the bars meant something. For example group by continent because right now there does not seem to be any correlation between countries.

This visualization shows country flags, which are grouped by continent, and the color in the flag signifizes how many vaccinations. I am making the assumption the data reflects the percentage of the population that is vaccinated would equate to the amount of color returning to the flag. For example the Seychelles flag has almost all the color returned, but the United States flag is only slightly colored. As seen in the previous visualization, the United States had the most vaccinations in the world. This visualization is unique, but it is really hard to determine the percentage of the population that is vaccinated because it is hard to determine what 100% color would look like. It is good however to use to compare between countries and see which have the most vaccinated per population.
