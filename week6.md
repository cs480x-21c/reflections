This week, I was pretty upset by a lot of things ranging from personal issues to political events. As such, I figured something that could help visualize the visceral rage I felt would be appropriate for this week's data vis reflection.

This visualization has eleven pages with one bar graph on each that depicts the gap between the differences of one thousand vs. one-hundred thousand, one-hundred thousand vs. one million, and so on and so forth.

The main issue this visualization suffers from is total size of the graphs. As the graphs continue, they seem to get smaller, making it harder to see in general. This issue could be due to my own screen resolution, but making the visualizations bigger overall will definitely aid the viewer's ability to really take in the differences.

While a bar graph is a great way to compare the gaps between these numbers, I think bubble charts would also work here. The only issue with those would be the inherent problem of radius vs diameter that comes with them, but at the end of the day, we don't need an exact amount to really see just how excessive one trillion is. I've seen similar visualizations like this in the past that were also more graphically interesting - for instance, one person actually sat down and counted out grains of rice (each one representing one-hundred thousand dollars).
