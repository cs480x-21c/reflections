Week 2 Reflection: Vegetation Index of Australia in 2019
---

For this week's reflection, I chose a [visualization](https://preview.redd.it/29ehy49fcng61.gif?format=mp4&s=e46fc12e018a0d37d466ddaa1f2eb8c341d1da22) from r/dataisbeautiful.
I chose this visualization because I think it presents the data in an appealing and understandable way. I think this type of visualization is great for environmental/geographic data because of how this visualization can tell a story. The visualization is animated to display the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) for the duration of 2019 on a map of Australia. The visualization includes a key that labels the NDVI from -0.2 to 0.6 with a color gradient of green. The larger the index is the darker the shade of green will be. It was interesting to see that the vegetation growth on the Northern coast of Australia and the Southern Coast of Australia occur at opposite times of the year. The visualization also has a monthly clock to indicate at what moment in time the current visual is at. I think this visualization functions to present the data in an easy to understand way. The creator indicates that the Python sentinelhub-py and eo-learn packers were used to create the visualization. It would be interesting to see a side-by-side of the 2019 and 2020 Australia NDVI data to see to what degree the wildfires in Australia impacted the vegetation growth. I think if the animation was slowed down just a little it would be easier to interpret.
