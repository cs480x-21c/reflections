Six Degrees of Wikipedia is based on the concept of six degrees of seperation. 
Using this tool you can either select random or input two wikipedia articles 
and it will visualize the path you would need to take, clicking links from the 
first page, to arrive at the second page. 

This game is incredibly interesting and it is often surprising what links connect 
two seemingly unrelated topics. Additionally, the graph is directional, so if 
you swap the start and end points you will often get a different result. This 
tool is a fantastic way to visualize the relation of topics, and quirks of 
language of phrases of speech in an engaging manner.
