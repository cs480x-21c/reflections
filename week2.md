# Week 2 Reflection - Elevation Soundscape

[Isle of Arran Elevation Soundscape](https://www.reddit.com/r/dataisbeautiful/comments/liah05/isle_of_arran_elevation_soubdscape_oc/)

Here's another visualization courtesy of Reddit's Data is Beautiful.
This visualization definitely is one that falls under the 'enjoy' categories,
but is less of a visualization as it is a kid of experience. 

The visualization consists of five lines representing the altitude of the Isle of 
Arran at five evenly spaced latitude lines. 
The lines then were associated with musical notes and harmonized together to create a sound that goes with the land.
This harmonized soundscape creates a cool effect to match music with the geography of the island.
The clear layout of the lines allows you to quickly see the general layout of the Isle of Arran.
The concept of using sound to represent geographical landscape is a very intriguing juxtaposition of senses and one that is well captured through this visualization.
