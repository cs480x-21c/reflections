Visual Capitalist is a website that i found through the twitter data visualization community and they have constant posts of cool data visualizations. This one in specific visualizes the most popular websites. Since millions of people have been working remotely for about a year now, I thought that it was important to see what the top 50 most popular websites currently are.

I think that it is super useful to have this data visualized with the bubbles - it really puts everything in perspective. I am also happy that they put a legend/description on how to read the visualization. The first thing that you notice is just how big Google is. When you hear of the antitrust lawsuits that they get every now and then it's hard to picture just how big they actually are. In addition, when looking for their competition, their are tiny in comparison. To my surprise, almost as many people use DuckDuckGo than Bing, which is dispoitning from a competition perspective.

I was also surprised to see that netflix has almost the same amount of visits as Amazon. But it really surprised me to see how small the Amazon vists in comparison to Google. I was also happy to see more people visit Wikipedia in the US than amazon. However, some things made me question the reliability of this visualization. It is really hard to believe that more people visit Yahoo than Amazon.

It was also surprising to see just how big CNN is (the only US newsite that is on the visualization).

Overall, I think the choice of color was very effective (not overwhelming at all) and it was interesting how the different ways to visualize data were combined into one data visualization. I believe it was very effective! It probably took a very long time to put this together.
