I would like to refect on the covid 19 vis tool this week.

This is part of the World Health Organization(WHO) website. This pandemic is reshaping our society and keep influencing people everywhere in the world,
so I think tracking the daily change of the covid cases and report them to people is important. 
This graph is color-coded to represent the number of the covid cases in each country. 
Users can compare the number of cases in each country immediately with those colors. The country with more cases is coded with dark blue, 
and the country with fewer cases is coded with light blue.

To view the detail of the cases in each county, uses can zoom in and put their mouse on that country on the map, and the total cases and death number will be displayed as a label.
Users also can click on that country to view more detail about the covid cases in that country. The Data Table is also available on this website. 
The table view has different attributes, including total cases, daily cases, total death, daily death, 
and users can total between the ascending rank or descending rank for each attribute. 
Users also can view the graphic information by clicking on the name of that country in the first column, and each graph is correspond to that attribute column.

In general, I think this is a very well-designed visualization tool to report the covid cases and it can help people to understand this pandemic.
One thing I think it can change is the color coding method, because it is difficult to represent a large range of number using a single color. It can switching between blue, 
yellow, and red to have a larger rang representation.
