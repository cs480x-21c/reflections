![Elon musk's effects on the market](https://i.redd.it/qhbevvm2ygf61.png)

This is a visualization that I found on reddit. It shows the correlation between Elon Musk's tweets and the prices of various stocks and cryptocurrencies. It shows large spikes closely following his tweets about this subject. In terms of vis design, I do enjoy the choice of color and I feel like this is a pretty effective design in terms of showing what the author meant to imply, that Musk has a direct impact on the market (with the exception of the last plot, where it is unclear if he had any real effect at all on the price). This visualization has one important pitfall though, having to do with the underlying theory of statistics. While these graphs do show a strong correlation, it appears the author is implying a a causal link, that is that the prices changed **because** of his tweets. While it might be reasonable to assume this, it is also entirely possible  that, being a sucessful entrepeneur, Musk was interested in these subjects because he believed they were being undervalued by the market as a whole. Truly visualizations can tell powerful stories, and the people who create them must be careful to ensure that they give accurate impressions of the true trends in data.
