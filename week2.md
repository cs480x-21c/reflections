### Week 2 Reflection - Social Media Peak Buzz

I looked again on r/dataisbeautiful because all of the visualizations on there are super interesting and applicable to modern topics. 
This visualization was interesting to me because I had a different view on the peaks of these social media platforms before seeing
this visualization. The source of this visualization is from Chartr. 

Twitter's turnaround is particularly interesting, as it seemed to dip in popularity, but has managed to be a constant social media platform
for quite some time. I think it will be interesting to see this type of visualization in a few years, especially with TikTok. I am curious
to see how popular they will be in the next few years, if they will die out or manage to have a turnaround like Twitter's.
