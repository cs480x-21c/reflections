Visualization (video): https://twitter.com/NHL/status/1360287801934286851

This is a pretty cool visualization I found posted by the NHL a couple of days ago. It shows the progression of goals scored across all the league's games over the course of one evening. I found this visualization especially interesting because it's not conveying information visually but also through audio, playing the different teams' goal horns whenever one of their pins shows up on the map. Another interesting feature to note is the attention to detail regarding the duration of the audio effects and the pins. While the time through the course of the evening is obviously sped up by quite a large factor, they still kept it linear. This means that some of the goal pins that show up last for much longer before the next one appears while others are immediately back to back or even simultaneous. I thought this was a really nice way of catering both to hockey fans who might be interested to see how their team compares and where they fell time-wise and numbers-wise in comparison to the other teams that were playing that night.
