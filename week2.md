This visualization is a two and a half minute video about what subreddits have the most comments each day. It starts in October of 2018 and goes until January of 2021.
As the dates cycle through you see the subreddits shift to show what is most popular on that day. At the top right of the video there are news headlines that correspond to the 
news of that certain day. It is interesting to see what happens each day and how the subreddits shift. Most of the time r/AskReddit has the most comments but there are a few days 
where a different subreddit shoots up in popularity. For example around the 2020 election r/politics has over 50 thousand more comments than r/AskReddit. This video also shows the
subreddit r/wallstreetbets at the end of January 2021 which has almost 400 thousand comments. The second highest subreddit is r/AskReddit with less than 100 thousand comments.
Although this is an extremely interesting visualization, the time frame of data is very large for the length of the video. It is hard for someone to effectively read the news 
stories and match the subreddit trends. The only way I could see to fix this would be shorten the news statements or slow the video down. Both of these options have consequences
though because shorten news statements would not give enough information and a slow video would not effectively show the drastic change in subreddit popularity. I think the bars
changing over time is what most people focus on and is the best part of the visualization.
