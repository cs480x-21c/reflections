I thought this was a very interesting data vis as it shows the US water usage at a country level, state level, and county level. When looking at the graph, it's not surprising where most states stand in terms of most water usage, with California and Texas being at the top. Something that personally surprised me was Idaho being in third, but it starts to make sense when you realize almost all of it is coming from Irrigation. One observation they point out is the massive difference between the east and the west, the vast majority of the water usage in the east is thermoelectric, while in the west it is overwhelmingly irrigation.

Further down, there are a few more visualizations going into more detail on the data. A pie chart shows the overall difference between water withdrawals, with irrigation and thermoelectric taking 78% of the total combined. The vis below that goes into more detail into some of the outliers in the data. Some interesting points here were Arkansas being the eastern most state dominated by irrigation. An expected outlier on the west coast is California, while it still follows the western trend of being majority irrigation, it is the only western state to have any visible amount of thermoelectric.
