This week I am bringing *Try to impeach this? Challenge accepted!* by *Karim Douieb*, a data scientist from Brussels. In October 2019 when impeachment charges were first brought against Donald Trump, Lara Trump tweeted a photo of the US that was color coded to counties won by Republicans and Democrats in 2016, captioned "Try to impeach this.". Karim responded "Challenge accepted!" with a gif of the first animation in his project.  
With a few short paragraphs of helpful narration at the top of each of the 5 pages, Karim begins shows that "Acres don't vote, people do". First reducing each county to a dot in its approximate location on the map, he colors them by the winning party in that county and scales their size by the number of votes collected, in buckets from 200,000 to 2.5M.  
As he advances, he shows that the "winner takes all" approach for representing these counties does not accurately convey the level of division between parties in those areas, and so the bubbles are divided into a red and a blue half, representing the % Republican vote received and the % Democrat.  
He then moves on to explain how in the U.S., things operate even differently with the electoral college, and uses a cartogram which encodes each elector as a hexagon to show that the large states do not carry as much weight as their acreage would bely.
Though his animations and ideas for differently representing the data are impressive, and they do convey that the difference between democratic and republican is not as big as Lara Trump would have people believe, there is no final quantitative comparison at the end of the visualization's experience. While the cartogram at the end shows that the Blue and Red portions of the electoral map are rather close to being even, I think that including something at the end with numbers would help to summarize the conclusion of the model.  
Since Karim's point was not to argue whether or not Trump won in 2016, but rather that American opinions are rather evenly divided, I think that having some kind of direct comparison would have been useful.
