This visualization definitely falls into the enjoyment category. Subreddits are sorted by number of comments per day and each day the bars are animated to demonstrate the volatile change from day to day. One thing that arises from this that is quite interesting is to see what is popular during a given month. For example, politics in November or the nba in June and July. I would like to se a variation of ths that would allow the user to play with the date themselves. I think this would be a fun way to discover what is trending on someoneâ€™s birthday, or the current month.
