This week, I will be reflecting on a bar chart of the total distance traveled by Chess Grandmaster Magnus Carlsen's pieces over his career.

I think the principal issue with this viz is that it leaves a lot for the user to extrapolate. Without being knowledgeable of chess theory, it's difficult to understand the significance of any of the data here (for example, why does Magnus move his king more when playing with the white pieces?). But as someone who has some amateur knowledge of chess theory, there are a lot of interesting things that can be extrapolated here. For example, the fact that Magnus moves his f, g, and h pawns the least out of all the other pawns could indicate that he tends to castle kingside in most of his games, and as such does not want to weaken his king position by moving those kingside pawns. Also notable here is the fact that he moves his king more as the white pieces, pointing towards his notable endgame abilities. Magnus is known to consistently convert winning positions with the white pieces into endgames (where many pieces are traded and few are left).
