Ok this one has some interesting traits. Firstly, the content of this bar chart is very entertaining: the reddit user “IHateTheLetterF” has apparently never used the letter F in their past 1000 comments. This stood out to me as this is some serious dedication, considering in my few years on reddit I don’t think I have anywhere close to 1000 comments. As for the chart, it is simple yet clean, and I like how it shows a relatively accurate distribution of english letters used in everyday conversation. Some letters that would stand out would be E as the most common, followed by T and A, and so on. (I was just playing words with friends before writing this, so the letter distribution stood out to me more than it typically would have.)
