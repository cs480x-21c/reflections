This vizualization shows the relation film length and IMDB rating through a scatter plot. It the higher ranking movies genraly are around 50min above 150min. The vizualization is good at showing that there is somewhat a trend and it is not completely random since it is moving a wave. The data might be this way because of a corellation of short films usually being made as an art piece and acredited directors making long films that they know their audience will sit through.
