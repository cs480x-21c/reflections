Strava's heat map at https://www.strava.com/heatmap is a simple visualization with great presentation.
The app it's connected to takes data from user-submitted workouts and plots all their paths on a map of the world.
There aren't too many options, and I question the decision to be able to turn off the paths and the map.
But in its default settings, the visualization is clear and to the point.
White hot spots easily contrast the smooth black background, and it's especially effective on the "heat" setting that looks like, well, a diagram of hot spots.
Not sure what the "gray" option accomplishes, and the "red" one looks creepy, for lack of a better term.
Regardless, this map is a demonstration of what it's like to have an extraordinary amount of data to work with.
Strava had over fifty MILLION users as of February 2020, and according to them, have been adding a million users every month since.
Even if every user only did one workout using the app, they would have a ridiculous amount of data.
Only a map as big as the world itself could show that much concentrated data.
