This visualization is about representing data from 2000 Hollywood movies regarding the screenplays which are broken down by gender and age. There are a lot of different visualizations featured on this web-page which are about. The first three are about screenplay dialogues based on Gender for only Disney films, then for 2000 hollywood films and then for the highest grossing films ranked by the US Box Office. The data about Disney films is interesting as it reflects upon the male majority in terms of dialogue in Disney's Princess films. Some of the films such as romantic comedies like "Pretty Woman" have 58% average number of male dialogues even though they had female lead actresses. This is because of the large number of male supporting characters. In the dataset of 2000 films, only 22% have actresses with most of dialogue. Other visualizations are about dialogues broken down on the basis of gender and age. This data shows interesting patterns: dialogues tend to decrease for women who are over the age of 40 while for men, the number of dialogues increase. As for lower age ranges, it is completely opposite. Overall, all the visualizations show the trends that males are supposedly given more opportunities in Hollywood than females in terms of dialogues. This data is not completely perfect as it doesn't reflect about the dialogues of minor characters as their data is poorly labelled on IMDB.
