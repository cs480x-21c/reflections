This was created by Eleanor Lutz in 2019.
Here is their CV: [http://tabletopwhale.com/img/Eleanor_Lutz_CV.pdf]

This visualization is a map of all known planets, 10000 asteroids, and 8000 randomized objects. They are each shown at their position on New Year's Eve in 1999. The data used to create this map is open to the public, from NASA. 

Eleanor changed the scale of the objects within the map from linear to a radial logarithmic scale, in order to map the map readable.

From the repository, you can see that Eleanor used python to plot the entire map. She then used Photoshop and Illustrator to add and adjust design features, as those programs are much better suited for the task. It can quickly be seen that this massive, complex map, can be broken down into individual, tangable, components. Thanks to her keeping the project open source, I am able to learn more about the capabilities of Matplotlib. Her code allows me to understand the individual components of the project, which I can learn from. Before seeing the code, I assumed the project was much more complex and difficult than it was, which is still an extensive project! This shows the power of open source code in giving viewers the ability to learn and understand.
