# Blue Whale Dodging Ships


This is an animated visualization shows the movements of ships and a single Whale
trying to dodge the ships to find food in the Los Lagos area of Chile.

The brown dots and lines indicate the docking points and movement trajectories of the ships.
The movements of the whale are tracked by the color blue.

The visualization is very interesting. However, the visualization by itself is confusing,
as it does not have legends or any other information. It is also unclear why movement of ships hinders whale's ability to eat.

With supplemental information, the visualization is very interesting and fascinating. It shows how much human activity
gets in the way of animals.

I would make sure to add a legend to this visualization. I would also add
a proper title including the location on the map, as longitude and latitude do not provide
a lot of detail to most of the population.
