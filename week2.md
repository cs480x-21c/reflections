Really cool vis of population charts I learned about a while back in environmental science. They show the age of a population of an area. I had never seen one animated though and I thought it was really cool that it changed over time. It does a great job of portraying it's information in a way that is understandable to the viewer. It also has some interactivity and allows the reader to hover over the vis to see more specific number as well as change the year the vis ends its animation. Age pyramid's are important for us to understand if a population is young or old, male or female. They can be really interesting to analyze and learn about different events that might have big impacts on the data and how it is represented.
