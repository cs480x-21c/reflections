![Data Vis Reflection 2](https://github.com/abell625/reflections/blob/master/DataVisReflection-2.jpg?raw=true)

This data visualization is a representation of several popular social media platforms' peak 'buzz'. In this case, buzz refers to the amount of google search volume for each platform. Note that the Y axes are not comparable except as a percent. For example, Snapchat in September 2015 would be 100%, just as Instagram in April 2020, but they may not have the same numerical value. I feel this visualization is simply interesting to look at, especially the timing of different peaks. It would be interesting to know the numerical value of each peak, however it might bloat the visualization with too much to look at. It's also fascinating to think about the power facebook had on this market, if you look at how high Facebook's buzz was and for how long.
