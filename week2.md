I found this vis and data to be rather interesting. I am not a reddit user, I'm just an outside observer, but I know about a few of the trends the vis shows. 
From the data, it seems that reddit tends to reflect both real world and internet trends. <br>
r/Ask reddit dominates for most of the video but you can see r/Coronavirus rise in march, when the virus really started to spread.<br>
You can see r/memes get a lot of traffic as people are in quarantine. You can see r/politics overtake ask reddit at the election peak and debates. <br>
You can see r/wallstreetbets explode towards the end, when the sub started heavily buying GameStop stocks to screw over hedge funds that were betting the GameStop stock to fail, 
costing the hedge funds millions.<br><br>

There are a areas where I think OP could improve. The animation is rather fast and can be hard to follow. Avideo is a good way to demo this kind of vis. 
Maybe OP could include a seperate link where users could have direct control over stepping, or animation speed. <br>
I would like the option to see a higher number of bars.
