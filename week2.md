This is a NASA Project where they have various visualizations.
These include "Eyes on the Earth", "Eyes on the Solar System", and "Eyes on Exoplanets".
I will mainly be discussing the "Eyes on the Earth visualization".
This visualization includes a lot of different data on various measurements of Earth taken from NASA satelites.
This includes information like what the Earth currently looks like (visible data), global temperatures, carbon dioxide levels, and more.
The visualization also shows what satelites the data is being collected from.
The data from the visualization is also constantly being updated.
Because of this, you can choose to see a summary of the most recent data like a 7 day average, or to see the data from a specific day.
You can also select different NASA satelites and see a 3d model of what that satelite looks like as it orbits the Earth.
When you select a satelite, there is a brief summary of what that satelite's mission is.
There is also the option to compare that satelite's size to a person or a school bus to help you understand how big or small the satelite is.
Overall, I think that this is a really cool visualization that is packed with information and lots of details about all the satelites.
