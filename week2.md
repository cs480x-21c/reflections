# Reflection Week 2
This week I stumbled upon a visualization of [Germany's population density](https://www.reddit.com/r/dataisbeautiful/comments/lgrtbq/oc_germanys_population_density_as_a_joy_plot_map/) 
made by a u/koen_vde on r/dataisbeuatiful which was done using waves of various amplitudes to illusrate the spikes in density.
