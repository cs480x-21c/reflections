# Reflection - Week 2

For my reflection this week, I am taking a look at the data visualization interface that yahoo finance has for the forex market. The forex market, a portmanteau of foreign exchange,
is the insanse version of the stock market. Unlike the stock market, forex is unregulated, and open 24/7 and thousands of price fluctuations  occur throughout a given
day, with forex investors paying attention to 1/100 of a penny changes in price. As would be expected, the amount of data is obscene. The yahoo finance site provides
a nice broad level overview of the major currencies.

My favorite part of this screen is the small detail graph next to each currency that gives a good overview of its general trend. The quality of this screen shot is not
very good, because the image is very small.

 When you click on the currency it brings you to an overview page that gives the graph of the "days" trading.

 While I am a big fan of how well all of the data is conveyed, the aesthetic of the site is not very good, it feels very crowded, if I were to make a change
 it would be to increase the space between the columns of data, and to make the detail graphs on the main page larger.
