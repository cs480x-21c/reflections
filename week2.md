This is a static visualization mapping enhancer interactions with nearby genes. This a fairly new concept in bioinformatics and could play a huge roll in genetic analysis, especially as the feild moves into the area of non-coding DNA.

Currently, any analysis of non-coding DNA measures open chromatin at certain regions. These regions are called regulatory elements, most of which are enhancers. These can interact with genes and cause an increase in expression. Analysis currently requires scientists to link these to genes to understand their effects. Most methods simply match them with the closest gene. However, there are many enhancers that interact with genes further away, or even on different chromosomes. Understanding and visualizing which genes enhancers interact with could completely change how we understand single cell epigonomic data.

What I have found is a static image that maps the regulatory elements of a particular gene. However, what I was looking for was a 3-dimensional, interactive visualization that maps all known regulatory regions to the genes that they interact with.
