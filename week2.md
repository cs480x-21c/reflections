This video contains a dynamic graph of character appearance times over the course of each Arrested Development episode. The left column shows the current standings of the whole show, the middle shows the current standings of the current season, and the right column shows the current standings of the particular episode. As such, it provides a lot of (accurate, insofar as the facial recognition software is accurate) information in a very simple form.

I'm a big fan of the side-by-side graphs that give way more detailed insight on what is otherwise a rather bland set of a lot of information, but there's also some changes I would make to further improve the graph.

Having a scale of some sort would help to turn this visualization even more informational. As such, a simple key of "this length equals X minutes" over each section would be a big improvement. Either  the text or the length can shift dynamically.

Aesthetically, the graphs could also be more appealing by choosing colors that aren't so aggressively full-saturation and full-brightness (e.g. colors for Lucille, Gob, Maeby, George...) especially when it comes to the characters who appear frequently. I do think it makes sense to have them be very different in order to distinguish each bar more easily, but the palette could definitely use some tweaking.

It's also really hard to see the final ranking for each episode or season due to a lack of pauses or anything. The last change I would make is having it be easier to pause and look at information (or, alternatively, having it be interactive and possible to change which pieces we are viewing).
